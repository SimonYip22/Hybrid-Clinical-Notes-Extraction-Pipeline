# Phase 3 - Transformer Contextual Validation Decisions

## Objective

- This document outlines the key design decisions for Phase 3: transformer-based validation of extracted clinical entities.
- Phase 3 builds on Phase 2, where deterministic rules generate high-recall, span-aligned candidate entities.
- The transformer layer converts these candidates into contextually valid, task-specific outputs via semantic classification.
- The goal is a scalable, reproducible, and clinically meaningful validation layer.

---

## Model Selection

### 1. Objective

- Select a model capable of sentence-level, context-aware classification of extracted entities
- Ensure compatibility with Phase 2 schema (`sentence_text`, `entity_text`)
- Balance:
  - Clinical performance  
  - Computational efficiency  
  - Scalability  
  - Reproducibility    

This serves as the formal reproducibility specification for Phase 3 model selection.

---

### 2. Design Context (From Phase 2)

Phase 2 produces:

- High-recall candidate entities:
  - `SYMPTOM`
  - `INTERVENTION`
  - `CLINICAL_CONDITION`
- Structured schema with:
  - Span (`entity_text`)
  - Context (`sentence_text`)
  - Validation placeholders (`is_valid`, `confidence`, `task`)

Input–Output Requirements:

- **Input:** `(sentence_text, entity_text)`  
- **Output:**
  - `is_valid` → binary classification  
  - `confidence` → probability score  
  - `task` → entity-specific interpretation  

The task is entity-level contextual classification, not sequence labelling or text generation

---

### 3. Nature of the Task (Critical Clarification)

The task requires contextual reasoning specific to each entity type:

| Entity Type         | Required Reasoning |
|--------------------|------------------|
| `SYMPTOM`           | Negation (present vs absent) |
| `INTERVENTION`      | Intent vs execution (planned vs performed) |
| `CLINICAL_CONDITION`| Temporality, certainty, diagnostic status |

Examples:
- “no chest pain” → symptom = **invalid (negated)**
- “plan to start antibiotics” → intervention = **invalid (not performed)**
- “history of MI” → condition = **invalid (not active)**

Key Requirement:
- Interpret meaning of entity within full sentence context
- Handle:
  - Clinical shorthand
  - Multi-clause sentences
  - Ambiguity and implicit meaning

---

### 4. Approaches Considered

#### 4.1 Model Types

| Approach                     | Strengths                              | Limitations |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| Rule-based systems          | Interpretable, deterministic           | Cannot model complex context, brittle to variation |
| Classical ML (e.g. LR, SVM) | Simple, efficient                    | Requires manual feature engineering, weak semantic understanding |
| CNNs (text classification)  | Capture local n-gram patterns          | Limited long-range context, weak for negation/temporal scope |
| RNNs / LSTMs                | Sequential modelling                   | Struggle with long-range dependencies, less efficient than transformers |
| Transformers (BERT-style)   | Full-context attention, strong semantics | Higher computational cost |

---

#### 4.2 Key Limitations of Non-Transformer Models

**1. Classical Machine Learning (e.g. Logistic Regression, SVM)**

These models rely on explicit feature engineering, typically using:
- Bag-of-words / TF-IDF representations  
- Manually engineered indicators (e.g. negation flags, keyword presence)

Limitations:
- No inherent understanding of word order or context  
- Inability to model relationships between tokens within a sentence  
- Heavy reliance on manually defined features such as:
  - Negation rules (“no”, “denies”)  
  - Temporal indicators (“history of”, “previous”)  

Implication:
- Reintroduces the same brittleness as rule-based systems  
- Poor generalisation to:
  - Unseen phrasing  
  - Clinical shorthand  
  - Complex sentence structures  


**2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs for Text)**

CNNs operate by learning local n-gram patterns through sliding convolutional filters.

Strengths:
- Effective at capturing short phrases (e.g. “chest pain”, “respiratory failure”)  
- Computationally efficient  

Limitations:
- Restricted receptive field (limited context window)  
- Weak modelling of long-range dependencies  

Failure cases:
- Negation scope: “no evidence of chest pain”  
- Multi-clause sentences: “patient denies chest pain but reports shortness of breath”  

Implication:
- Cannot reliably determine whether an entity is valid within full sentence context  


**3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs / LSTMs)**

RNN-based models process text sequentially, maintaining a hidden state across tokens.

Strengths:
- Designed for sequential data  
- Can, in theory, capture contextual flow  

Limitations:
- Difficulty capturing long-range dependencies:
  - Early tokens (e.g. negation) may not effectively influence later tokens  
- Gradient degradation over long sequences (even with LSTM/GRU variants)  
- Limited parallelisation → slower training and inference  

Failure cases:
- Long clinical sentences with multiple clauses  
- Context-dependent meaning spanning distant tokens  

Implication:
- Inconsistent performance for:
  - Negation handling  
  - Temporal reasoning  
  - Complex clinical phrasing 

---

#### 4.3 Conclusion

Across all non-transformer approaches:

- Context is either not modelled or only partially captured through manual features or local patterns
- Long range dependencies and complex sentence structures are not effectively handled
- Robust handling of negation, temporality, and intent is not achievable without extensive manual engineering

These limitations directly conflict with the requirements of Phase 3, where:

- Entity validity depends on full-sentence contextual interpretation
- Clinical meaning is often distributed across multiple tokens and clauses  

As a result, non-transformer models are not suitable for this task, motivating the selection of transformer-based architectures.

---

#### 4.3 Why Transformers Are Selected

Transformers address these limitations through:

- **Self-attention mechanism:** Directly model relationships between all tokens in a sentence  
- **Context-aware representations:** Meaning of a word depends on surrounding words (contextualized embeddings)  
- **Implicit feature engineering:** Negation, temporality, and intent are learned from data, no manual rule encoding

This is critical for distinguishing:

- **Negation:** “no chest pain” vs “chest pain”
- **Intent vs execution:** “planned intubation” vs “intubated”  
- **Temporality:** “history of stroke” vs “acute stroke”  

Transformer-based models are the minimal class of models capable of reliably performing the required contextual validation task.

### 5. Transformer Classes Considered

#### 5.1 Transformer Variants

| Model Type              | Strengths                                  | Weaknesses |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| **General BERT**           | Efficient, well-supported                   | Weak clinical understanding |
| **Clinical BERT variants** | Domain-specific language understanding      | Slightly heavier |
| **Large LLMs (GPT, Gemma)**| Strong reasoning, flexible                  | Expensive, non-deterministic, poor structure control, unstable outputs |
| **Custom-trained**   | Fully tailored                             | Requires large labelled dataset |

---

#### 5.2 Encoder vs Generative Models

**Encoder Models (BERT-style):**

- Input → full sequence processed simultaneously  
- Output → fixed contextual representation → classification head  
- Designed for:
  - Classification
  - Token labelling
  - Sentence-level understanding  

Properties:
- Bidirectional context (full sentence considered at once)
- Outputs structured probabilities (e.g. logits → softmax)
- Deterministic at inference:
  - Given fixed weights and no stochastic layers (e.g. dropout disabled), the same input produces identical output
- Strong alignment with structured prediction tasks

**Generative Models (LLMs):**

- Input → sequential token generation  
- Output → generated text (token-by-token)  
- Designed for:
  - Open-ended reasoning
  - Text generation
  - Instruction following  

Properties:
- Autoregressive decoding (predict next token repeatedly)
- Output depends on:
  - Prompt phrasing  
  - Decoding strategy (temperature, top-k, top-p)  
- Inherently probabilistic:
  - Even with temperature = 0, outputs may vary due to:
    - Implementation-level nondeterminism
    - Tie-breaking between tokens
- Produces unstructured text rather than fixed schema outputs  

---

#### 5.3 Why LLMs Are Not Used

Although LLMs are powerful, they are fundamentally misaligned with the requirements of this pipeline.

**1. Task mismatch**

- Required task: Binary classification (`is_valid`) with structured outputs  
- LLM capability: Free-form text generation  
- Implication:
    - Requires prompt engineering to simulate classification  
    - Adds unnecessary abstraction and failure modes 

**2. Output instability and lack of strict determinism**

- LLM outputs are probabilistic by design:
  - Token generation involves probability distributions  
- Even with constrained decoding, outputs can vary across runs, hardware, or implementations  
- Problems:
  - Cannot guarantee strict JSON schema compliance  
  - Requires post-processing, output validation, and error handling layers  
- In contrast, encoder models produce:
  - Fixed-dimensional outputs
  - Stable probabilities
  - Fully reproducible predictions 

**3. Scalability and efficiency constraints**

- LLMs have high computational cost per inference and slow sequential decoding  
- Pipeline requirement:
  - High-throughput batch classification over thousands of entities  
- Implication:
  - LLMs are inefficient and costly at scale 

**4. Reproducibility and auditability**

- Clinical pipelines require:
  - Stable outputs  
  - Reproducible behaviour  
  - Auditability of decisions  
- LLMs are sensitive to:
  - Model updates  
  - Prompt changes  
  - Sampling behaviour  
- Encoders provide:
  - Deterministic forward pass 
  - Consistent outputs across runs  

LLMs are better suited for exploration, prototyping, and complex reasoning tasks, but not for high-throughput, structured, deterministic validation pipelines in clinical contexts.

### 6. Transformer Decision

#### 6.1 Final Model Class

Chosen approach:

1. Clinical-domain pretrained **encoder transformer**
2. Supervised **fine-tuning for classification**

Candidate models:
- BioClinicalBERT  
- PubMedBERT  
- ClinicalBERT 

---

#### 6.2 Why Clinical Pretrained Models

Clinical text differs significantly from general language:

- Abbreviations: “SOB”, “PRBC”, “NGT”  
- Domain-specific terminology  
- Fragmented, shorthand-heavy syntax  
- Non-standard grammar  

General-domain models:

- Trained on Wikipedia / BooksCorpus  
- Limited exposure to clinical language  
- Misinterpret:
  - Abbreviations  
  - ICU shorthand  
  - Domain-specific phrasing  

Clinical-domain models:

- Pretrained on:
  - MIMIC clinical notes (BioClinicalBERT)  
  - PubMed abstracts (PubMedBERT)  
- They learn:
  - Clinical vocabulary  
  - Abbreviation usage  
  - Real-world documentation patterns  

Outcome:

- Better contextual understanding  
- Higher classification accuracy  
- Reduced need for large fine-tuning datasets  

---

#### 6.3 Why Fine-Tuning vs Training from Scratch

**A. Model Training**

Model training from scratch involves:

- Initialising model weights randomly  
- Training on very large corpora (millions–billions of tokens)  
- Learning:
  - Language structure  
  - Grammar  
  - Domain knowledge  
  - Semantic relationships  
- Requirements:
  - Massive labelled or unlabeled datasets  
  - Significant compute (GPUs/TPUs)  
  - Long training time  

Why training from scratch is not feasible:

- Phase 2 does not provide:
  - Large-scale labelled datasets  
  - Sufficient data diversity  
- Resource constraints:
  - Compute cost is prohibitive  
  - Time-to-iteration is too slow  
- Most importantly:
  - The task does not require learning language from scratch  
  - Only requires adapting existing language understanding  

---

**B. Fine-Tuning**

Fine-tuning involves:

- Starting from a pretrained model  
- Adding a task-specific classification head  
- Training on a smaller labelled dataset  

Process:

1. Input: `(sentence_text, entity_text)`  
2. Encode full sentence context  
3. Extract contextual representation  
4. Pass through classification head  
5. Optimise for task-specific objective (e.g. binary classification loss)  

Why fine-tuning is appropriate:

- Leverages pretrained knowledge as language understanding is already learned  
- Requires much less data and less compute  
- Adapts model to:
  - Task-specific definitions (e.g. “valid intervention”)  
  - Entity-specific semantics  

Fine-tuning transforms a general clinical language model into a task-specific clinical reasoning model without needing large-scale training.
