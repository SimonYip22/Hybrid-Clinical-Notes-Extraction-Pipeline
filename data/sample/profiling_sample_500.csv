55 male admitted to T/SICU in respiratory distress from [**Hospital Ward Name 36**] 7. Pt is POD 2 from EGD, lap nissen converted to open laparotomy, gastroplasty, fundiplication and ventral hernia repair. He has had poor pain control and is followed by the acute pain service. As a result, he had poor mobility and pulmonary toileting, and has developed a large right pleural effusion with subsequent lobular collapse. There is also concern for pneumonia. He was transferred here for pulmonary care and a thoracentesis was performed with pigtail insertion at the bedside. He has required high-flow neb oxygen and albuterol/atrovent nebs.

Neuro: A&Ox3, anxious at baseline, rx ativan for calming effect.

   endplate of C7 vertebral body with approximately 2 mm of
   retropulsion of the posterior cortex without significant canal
   stenosis.  2. Degenerative disease with facet changes as
   described above. Widening at C3-4 on the right is likely
   chronic. 3. Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectatic changes
   are better assessed on corresponding CT torso performed
   concurrently.

   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global
   systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
   aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic
   valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild calcific
   aortic stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o lady with CHF, AF, HTN was discharged from Trauma service
   yesterday after she was admitted here with C7 fracure secondary to fall
   now presents with hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Patient became hypotensive after receiving 40 mg IV
   furosemide and cardizem medications.  She has also recieved ativan
   prior to these medications.  She is afebrile and does not have
   leukocytosis.  No signs or symptoms of infection currently.  Patient
   was found to have episodes of really low BP during recent
   hospitalization.  Unlcear etiology. She was started on midodrine. Blood
   pressures responding to hydration indicate that she might have been
   dehydrated.  Cardiac ischemia will remain low in the differential as
   mentioned below.
   - follow cultures
   - will hold off on antibiotics as no evidence of infection currently
   - patient has received 1 uPRBC from ED for chronic anemia, no active
   signs or symptoms of bleeding
   - random cortisol, ? [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim was normal during last admission
   - unclear why patient was started on clonidine, will verify with
   provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] discuss tapering it off with team vs discontinuing
   .
   # Troponitis: Cardiology saw the patient in ED and did not think that
   there is any acute cardiac etiologies.  Patient does have nonspecific
   EKG changes.  Most likely demand ischemia in the setting of
   hypotension.  Cardiology has seen the consulted in ED.
   - cycle CE
   - asa
   - supratherapeutic INR
   .
   # Chronic vent dependence:  Intubated for ? glottic swelling.  s/p
   pleural effusion drainiage during recent admission.  However it appears
   that her pleural fluid has reaccumilated.  Transudative effusion per
   prior taps.
   - now s/p trach
   - wean off vent as she tolerates
   .
   # Pleural effusion: Unclear etiology.  ? [**12-30**] to diastolic heart
   failure.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled.
   - rate control
   - supratherapeutic INR, will hold coumadin
   .
   # Anemia:  Most likely secondary to recent admission and frequent
   phlebotomy.  Normocytic.
   - normal vit B12 and folate on [**2194-1-14**]
   - will check iron panel
   .
   # ? NHL:
   - need to verify history with PCP
   .
   # ? Thyroid disease:
   - need to verify with PCP
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now, TF in morning, replete lytes prn, failed speech

   HPI:
   24 year old man with a history of episodic dizziness, h/o pneumothorax
   who presented to the emergency departement with fever, sore throat,
   cough, and dizziness with BP 84/52 upon arrival at the ED. He was in
   his usual state of health until 1 day prior to admission, when he noted
   sore throat. On the morning of admission, he awoke with persistent sore
   throat, fever, rhinorrhea, cough, back pain, dizziness, and nausea.
   Given his nausea, he had minimal PO intake including a [**Company 9513**] and a
   small amount of water.
   He reports a history of intermittent dizziness and feeling faint
   consistent with his current dizziness.
   He denies neck pain, rash, photophobia, abdominal pain, dysuria, and
   diarrhea. He has had no sick contacts with similar symptoms, recent
   travel, contact with animals, outdoor activities, or sexual contact.
   Initially it was difficult to elicit a history because he would not
   readily answer questions; this resolved with fluid replacment.
   In the ED, his vital signs were initially T103.6 HR 118 BP 84/52 RR16
   O2 Sat 100.  He was given 4L NS with increases of SBP up to 110s but
   with subsequent drops back to 80s/90s. Suspicion for meningitis was
   low, but he refused LP so he was treated empirically with 2g
   ceftriaxone and 1g of vancomycin. He also received Torodol. Blood
   cultures were collected.
   On the floor,  his vital signs were T99.6 HR 88 BP 104/54 RR 17 O2 sat
   95% RA. He received an additional leter of LR and reported that his
   dizziness had improved.

   Microbiology: Micro:  Blood cultures pending
   Assessment and Plan
   24 year old man with a history of episodic dizziness, h/o pneumothorax
   who was admitted for fever and hypotension that responded to fluid
   resuscitation.
   1) Fever, up to 103.6. Associated with sore throat, rhinorrhea,
   headache, and nausea. No signs of meningismus, no leukocytosis.
   Questionable pathcy opacity in left lower lobe on CXR. U/A negative,
   blood cx pending. No LP. Although viral URI/ influenza is the most
   likely cause, the differential diagnosis includes  pneumonia and
   meningitis. The suspicion for bacterial meningitis is low given
   generally nontoxic appearance and lack of clinical symptoms. However,
   he declined an LP and was subsequently started on ceftriaxone and
   vancomycin empirically for meningitis. If another sources can be
   confirmed, these antibiotics can likely be discontinued. A repeat CXR
   can lend insight into the possibility of PNA.  If PNA is suspected, we
   can collect a sputum culture. In the meantime, we can D/C vancomycin,
   continue cetriaxone and start azithromycin for empirically for
   community-acquired PNA. Although elevated fever and hypotension
   potentially meet a SIRS picture, the response of his hypotension to
   fluid resuscitation and his history of poor PO intake make septic
   vasodilation less likely than volume depletion.
   -Repeat CXR to evaluate for PNA.
   -D/C
   -Follow up blood cultures.
   -If fevers continue to spike and alternate source is not identified,
   revisit option of LP with the patient and continue empiric treatment
   for meningitis.
   2.) Hypotension. As per above, differential includes vasodilation in
   association with SIRS vs. volume depletion but his response of his
   hypotension to fluid resuscitation and his history of poor PO intake
   make septic vasodilation less likely than volume depletion.
   -IVF for SBP<100
   -
   3.) Hypophosphatemia to phosphate 0.6.

   Reason for MICU admission: Hypotension
   HPI:
   This is an 84 yo M with a past medical history significant for multiple
   myeloma (gets care at DF), on dexamethasone, who presents to the ED
   today with complaints of weakness and fatigue for several days. He does
   not endorse any localizing symptoms, but notes that he is ""not feeling
   well"" and feels weak. He describes that he had a near syncopal event
   yesterday. He describes that he was about to leave his home and
   suddenly fell. He did not have his walker with him. He endorses a
   prodrome of lightheadedness and felt ""woozy"" but denies loss of
   consciousness.  He did scrape his right knee and side of the face a
   little bit. He saw his gerontologist the same day, but felt better by
   that time. He describes possible fever/chills at home, but did not
   measure his temperature. He denies any n/v/d, sick contacts, myalgias,
   chest pain, palpitations or headache. He is complaining about severe
   sweating that occurs at night without any reason for which he had a
   work up at the VA that was unrevealing.
   Upon arrival to the ED, initial vital signs were 98.2 80 80/43 20 98%
   on room air. Tmx was 99.7. Exam was nonlocalizing with a benign
   abdominal exam. His lactate was 1.3, but labs were otherwise
   significant for a leukocytosis to 26,000 with a left shift, acute renal
   failure with a creatine of 2.3. He had a normal cxr, neg UA.
   Blood/urine cx were drawn and he was given 3L of NS with little
   improvement in his blood pressure. ECG was without acute change, and a
   troponin was elevated at 0.44, prompting a cardiology consult who
   advised that this was likely in the setting of ARF and hypotension and
   was not ACS. He was given an aspirin. At this time, the concern for
   relative adrenal insufficiency was raised and he was given a dose of
   stress dose hydrocortisone, with subsequent improvement in his BP to
   88/39. He was mentating clearly throughout.
   He is being admitted to the MICU for hypotension. At time of transfer
   to the MICU, his vitals were 73 88/39 20 96%ra, but he subsequently
   dropped his pressures to the 60
s. A CVL was placed, he was started on
   levophed and given a dose of vanco, CTX and flagyl. He now has a CVL
   and 2 18g PIV's for access, and has been started on his 4th L NS.
   Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient is alert and talkative. He feels
better
. He notes that he always has some amount of shortness of
   breath, and although he appears somewhat breathless, he will not
   endorse that this is any worse from his baseline. He denies pleuritic
   chest pain, palpitiations.

   Prior TTE [**2156**] - Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. There may be a small interatrial shunt by color Doppler
   examination. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
   left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is markedly
   dilated The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
   aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. The
   left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   No intracardiac mass identified (cannot definitively exclude).

   ECG: No acute STTWC
   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo M with history of MM, DVT, admitted with hypotension and ARF.
   #. Hypotension - Patient is afebrile, with a leukocytosis and no
   localizing symptoms. Hypotension was refractory to 3L of NS. Elevated
   WBC could be from dexamethasone, but there is a left shift and a mild
   bandemia. Suspicion is for occult infection compounded by poor PO
   intake and relative adrenal insufficiency in the setting of chronic
   steroid use. Other possibilties include PE, but no shortness of breath
   or tachycardia; cardiogenic shock is unlikely, as troponin elevation is
   less likely ACS and more likely the result of ARF and hypotension. As
   for source of possible sepsis, patient does not have any localizing
   symptoms. He is s/p CCY, UA is unremarkable, CXR is clear, abdominal
   exam is benign, no rashes. Given that he is relatively
   immunocompromised, it could be bacterial, atypicals or perhaps viral or
   fungal infection leading to poor PO intake and dehydration and actually
   not sepsis at this point. ?influenza, but no characteristic symptoms.
   - continue stress dose steroids for now
   - continue IVF aggressively overnight with caution for his history of
   valvular dysfunction
   - maintain CVP>10-12 mmHg, MAP>65
   - measure CvO2 sat
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vanco, zosyn, azithro
   - hold home anti-hypertensives until hemodynamically stable
   - r/o flu
   #. ARF - likely prerenal azotemia. IVF overnight. If BUN/Cr continue to
   rise, will send urine lytes.
   #. Leukocytosis - either secondary to infection or perhaps due to
   dexamethasone. Will hold off on antibiotics until there is a clear
   source or if patient decompensates.
   #. Elevated troponin - no EKG changes. This is likely in the setting of
   hypotension and ARF. Can complete ROMI, but low probability for ACS.
   #. Multiple Myeloma - multiple myeloma for which he takes dexamethasone
   weekly on a regular basis.  He gets most of his medications as well as
   labs done at the VA and his oncologist is at [**Hospital3 **].  He recently
   has been having problems with pain in his back and legs.
   #. History of DVT- continue coumadin
   #. Depression - continue citalopram
   #. Benign prostatic hypertrophy - continue finasteride at nighttime.

   HPI:
   75yo woman with ESRD on HD, HTN, BAD, some cognitive impairment /
   Parkinsonianism who apparently became upset about her HD (something
   related to interpersonal issues at the center at which she gets HD?)
   and missed at least 2 sessions of HD. The PCP was called by the family
   who recommended that the patient be sent to the ER given she had missed
   several sessions of HD. In the ER she was seen by Psych, cleared from
   their perspective, and was admitted to Medicine for further treatment
   and eventual HD. Also in the ER her SBP was in the 200-220s. K was 6.1;
   EKG with peaked Ts. Given calcium chloride.
   On the floor, SBP remained markedly elevated (SBPs in the 250s) and was
   tachypneic. Given 10mg of Hydralazine but didn
t respond. Given the
   hypertension and tachypnea she was admitted to the MICU. On arrival to
   the MICU she was given Labetalol IV with little effect and a Nitro gtt
   was initiated with good response. This was weaned off over the course
   of the night.
   She did remain tachypneic in the MICU. ABG revealed 7.45 / 45 / 497.
   She was on BiPAP but still tachypneic. Renal was consulted and
   evaluated the patient. They felt that dialysis was indicated but could
   not coordinate this acutely; she was intubated in the interim for
   persistent respiratory distress in the setting of volume overload and
   an expected delay in dialysis. Her settings were 450 / 18 / 5 / 40%;
   repeat ABG
   She remains sedated on Fentanyl gtt and intermittent Versed boluses.
   Her SBP has come down over the course of the evening to the 120-130s on
   these meds. K has remained persistently elevated from 6.2-6.5 and she
   received insulin / glucose and more calcium chloride.

   75yo woman with HTN, ESRD on HD, and other issues who is here after
   having missed at least two sessions of HD over the course of the past
   week presenting with profound hypertension and volume overload.
   Developed respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical
   intubation.
   1)       Respiratory failure: Intubated for increased work of breathing
   in the setting of volume overload. Her pH was a bit low this morning so
   her tidal volume was increased to 550, she continues to overbreath the
   vent. Would recheck an ABG this morning to follow pH, CO2. Hope to wean
   from ventilator after HD today
 the primary mechanism of her
   respiratory failure appears to be volume overload.
   2)       Hypertension: Improved with Fentanyl, Versed and intubation.
   Holding other antihypertensives at this time given her SBPs have
   decreased to the 130s. Would back off on the sedation in anticipation
   of potential extubation today. Goal SBP 130-180s.
   3)       Hyperkalemia / ESRD: plan for HD today. Hope to be able to
   wean respiratory support after HD. Would recheck K this morning given
   that it was 6.5 with AM labs. Continue Renagel, calcium carbonate.
   Appreciate Renal assistance.
   4)       ID: No clear e/o systemic infection, however, her CXR is
   striking for asymmetric opacification on the right compared to the
   left. This certainly could be asymmetric volume overload however
   infection is also a possibility (aspiration in the setting of
   intubation.) No plans for empiric antibiotics at this time. Will send
   any sputum for culture. Monitor for fevers. Will check CXR after HD.
   5)       Psych: Continue home anti-psychotics. Psych to see after
   extubation.
   6)       GI: No active issues. Stress ulcer prophylaxis after
   establishing oral feeding tube.
   7)       Code: Presumptively full. Dispo: MICU for now.

   Assessment and Plan
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
 HYPOGLYCEMIA
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
   ===========================
   Patient with hypoglycemia possibly due to missing breakfast this AM,
   mistaken dose of insulin this AM (patient admits to poor vision and he
   does self-administer insulin), and mildly worse renal function which,
   in setting of glyburide may have led to prolonged insulin effect. Blood
   sugars improved now; will allow patient to eat. Put on sliding dose of
   insulin tonight. Resume regular insulin in AM. Consider holding
   glyburide for now.
   Hyperkalemia likely due to decreased urine output and mild worsening of
   renal function. Would give 500 cc bolus of NS now and follow urine
   output and potassium.
   Transient elevation of lipase of unclear etiology. Unlikely to have had
   transient obstruction with normal LFT's. Continue to monitor. Patient
   is hungry with no abdominal pain, which makes acute pancreatitis
   unlikely.
   Abnormal ECG without chest pain. Would cycle cardiac enzymes and repeat
   ECG in AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male admitted with altered mental status, fever and SOB.
   Intubated for a/w protection, subsequently became hypotensive requiring
   Levophed. Recent history is notable for endocarditis (was placed on
   vancomycin for 6 week of treatment. Was also treated for acinetobacter
   pneumonia with Unasyn/Tobramycin x 14 days. Unasyn was completed
   yesterday prior to discharge. He has recently also had MRSA PICC
   infection.  Note that his presentation is very similar to his last
   admission.
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure- intubated for a/w protection but has
   significant RLL pneumonia.
   - unclear if this is a new aspiration vs extension of previous
   pneumonia (by comparison to [**11-15**] [**Last Name (un) **] CT)
   - discussed with ID, their input is very much appreciated. Will
   continue Vancomycin/Zosyn but only continue Bactrim if hemodynamically
   unstable or showing persistent signs of sepsis
   - obtain nBAL for gram stain and culture
   - Currently on A/c with pO2 157 on 50% FiO2.
   - SBT in AM, baseline CO2 level of approx 55
   - Atovent/Albuterol
   2) Sepsis- completed tobra/unasyn x 14 d, plan to continue vanco for
   endocarditis (MRSA and vanc sensitive enterococcus)
   - Fever sources include pneumonia, aspiration pneumonitis, PICC sepsis
   (removed), endocarditis
   - maintain MAP>65, wean off pressors
   - pancultured - follow up
   3) Septic/hypovolemic shock
   - hypernatremia (likely dehydrated) with low urine output, hypotension
   - other labs notable for elevated hct, BUN, creat, HCO3
   4) Pleural plaques / rounded atelectasis - due to asbestos exposure
   5)Acute on chronic Renal insufficiency
   6)Altered Mental Status - likely multifactorial from sepsis, renal
   failure, Parkinson's
   7) Parkinson's
 sinemet and ropinorole

   EKG.
   [**2189-2-24**] at 7:43 AM.  EK shows NSR at 96 npm.  PR interval of 192.  QRS
   of 110 with LBBB morphology.  TWI in II, III, F, V4-V6.  q waves in II,
   III, F, V5-V6.  LVH.  Right axis deviation.
   .
   Echo:  [**2188-10-24**].
   The left atrium is dilated. A left-to-right shunt across a stretched
   patent foramen ovale is seen at rest. There is moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There is mild global
   left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-50%). The right ventricular
   free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal
   with mild global free wall hypokinesis. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
   prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis leaflets appear to
   move normally, the transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis,
   and there is no aortic regurgiation. However, motion of the aortic
   annulus is abnormal. This could be related to complex surgical repair
   itself, but may also suggest partial dehiscence. No definite masses or
   vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. A bioprosthetic mitral valve
   prosthesis is present. The prosthetic mitral leaflets appear normal.
   The gradients are higher than expected for this type of prosthesis,
   although this is almost certainly related to the amount of
   regurgitation, rather than obstruction of the prosthesis. A moderate to
   severe (3+) paravalvular mitral prosthesis [**Month/Day/Year 2400**] is present. No mass or
   vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
   regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
   increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is
   a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   .
   IMPRESSION: Abnormal aortic prosthetic ring motion, concerning for
   partial dehiscence. Moderate to severe paravalvular prosthetic mitral
   regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild biventricular
   systolic dysfunction. Elevated left atrial pressures with left-to-right
   interatrial shunting at rest. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
   .
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5619**] is a 32 yo male with HIV/AIDs, CD4 of 5, here with LLE calf
   pain/swelling, as well as nausea/vomiting/diarrhea and dyspnea on
   exertion.
   .
   1.  LLE swelling.  Patient primary concern and reason for admission is
   LLE swelling for three days and significant pain.  Pain is so great
   that patient has difficulty placing calf on the bed.  High suspician
   for DVT given patients sedentary lifestyle.  However, given bandemia,
   may be due to cellulitis.  Heparinization in this patient would be
   difficult given INR of 3 and thrombocytopenia, so may require IVC
   filter placement if found to have DVT.
   - LENIs to r/o DVT
   - consider LLE x-ray if negative for DVT given severity of symptoms
   - Vanco qHD to cover a cellulitis
   - follow wbc, fever curve
   - dilaudid for pain
   .
   2.  Dyspnea on exertion.  Patient reports DOE over the past few days to
   weeks (poor historian so timeline not completely clear).  He denies
   chest pain, cough, sputum production, but does endorse worsening LE
   edema and chronic orthopnea.  DOE may be related to CHF in setting of
   poor valvular function (AR with valve dehissence, MR, and TR).
   However, given leg swelling, at risk for PE as well.  Of note, pt has
   baseline RAD on EKG, but tacychardic here with no change in O2
   requirements .  Pneumonia less likely given that there is not history
   of fevers, cough, sputum production, however given immunosuppressed
   state and bandemia, this remains a possibility.  CXR shows RLL collapse
   but this could be secondary to pneumonia.  Given that CXR is not
   typical for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is reportedly on bactrim prophylaxis at home,
   will hold off on empiric therapy for PCP at this point.
   - induced sputum for gram stain and culture and PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] blood cultures
   - urine legionella
   - fluid removal with HD (non-emergent)
   - consider CTA if respiratory status does not improve with HD
   .
   3.  Nausea/vomiting.  Patient has history of nausea/vomiting, abdominal
   pain and diarrhea.  Given CD4 count of 5, at risk for infectious
   etiologies.  However, given history of endocarditis, may have septic
   emboli resulting in mesenteric ischemia as well.  Given abdominal
   tenderness in patient who is immunosuppressed from HIV and bandemia,
   and elevated lactate, will further evaluate abdominal pain with
   imaging.
   - CT abd/pelvis to evaluate for ischemic or infectious colitis
   - stool studies
   .
   4.  Elevated INR.  INR has never been greater than 2 and INR 1.6 last
   month.  Currently not on anticoagulation.  Likely element of
   malnutrition, but concern for chronic liver failure given history of
   HBV, low albumin, low fibrinogen, low haptoglobin, hepatosplenomegaly
   with ascites on prior imaging.  Heb B core Ab positive, but surface
   antigen and Ab are negative likely representing prior infection.  HBV
   and HCV viral load negative in [**10-25**].  Patient denies alcohol use, but
   was reportedly taking 6+ percocet per day.  Liver failure may be due to
   hepatic congestion due to CHF.
   - check hep B viral load and serologies
   - check hep C viral load and serologies
   - check LFTs
   - tyelenol level, NAC if positive
   - vitamin K 5 mg po for three days
   - abdomen CT to evaluate for hepatosplenomegaly and ascites
   .
   5.  Thrombocytopenia.  Platelet count has been declining over the last
   year, now with more precipitous decline since [**2188-12-18**].  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   secondary to splenomegaly versus HIV thrombocytopenia versus DIC.
   Supsect that thrombocytopenia is due to worsening liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  Although there are some labs that are concerning for DIC
   (thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen, 1+ schistocytes), this is more
   likely due to liver failure (low haptoglobin, ascites,
   hepatosplenomegaly).
   - trend DIC labs
   - trend platelets
   .
   6.  Bandemia.  Though WBC is not elevated and pt denies fevers, there
   is concern for occult infection given patient
s immunosuppressed state
   and history of several infections (endocarditis, aortic root abscess,
   eyelid infection).  Possible sources include pneumonia (RLL collapse on
   CXR), colitis (nausea/vomiting/diarrhea), cellulitis (LLE erythema
   though it is cool not warm). Patient does not make urine.  AVF is not
   tender.
   - induced sputum for gram stain/culture
   - stool studies
   - follow wbc, fever curve
   - ID consult for Abx recommendations (?Vanco/Zosyn)
   .
   6.  HIV/AIDS.  CD4 count of 5. Per patient, would like another trial of
   HAART but is awaiting arrival of meds, though not clear if this is
   true.
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis
   .
   7.  ESRD on HD. Now with evidence of fluid overload.
   - continue HD
   - renal aware that he is here
   - continue sevelamer, calcium carbonate, cinacalcet
   .
   8.  Lactic acidosis.  Hypothermic in ED with bands, concerning for
   sepsis etiology.  However, patient has not been hyoptensive here and
   has evidence of liver failure by labs and imaging.
   - trend lactate
   - vanco for ?cellulitis on LLE
   - consider empiric abx for resistant infections (?Vanco/zosyn)
   .
   9.       Hypertension.  On metoprolol, hydralaine, amlodipine, and
   captopril at home for HTN.  Given elevated lactate, will hold
   antihypertensives.
   - hold antihypertensives
   .
   10.  Anion gap.  Likely secondary to renal failure and lactic acidosis.
   - follow anion gap
   .
   11.  Volume overload.  Patient has elevated JVP with poorly functioning
   aortic valve due to valve dehissence.
   - volume removal with HD
   - serial EKGs
   .
   12.  H/o endocarditis.  H/o of aortic valve endocarditis c/b abscess
   and dehissence.  Currenly off abx for this.
   - echo to evaluate valve function
   .
   13.    Elevated troponin.  No episode of chest pain and no current
   chest pain.  EKG unchanged.  Elevated troponin is rise from prior, but
   will trend.
   -          trend CK, CK-MB, troponin
   -          echo to evaluate for regional wall abnormalities
   -          aspirin
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, renal diet
   .
   Prophylaxis: Hold HSQ due to elevated INR, pneumoboots.
   .
   Access: PIVs x 2

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 32M advanced HIV/AIDS (last CD4 5) c/b
   AVR/MVR for endocarditis with known abscess, CHB c pacer c/b pocket
   infection and removal, partial MV dehiscence and regurg, as well as
   ESRD from FSGN. He is now admitted with LLE calf pain and swelling.
   Also reports progressive DOE over weeks, and diarrhea/vomitting over
   past few days. Treated in ED with antibiotics.
   Exam notable for Tm BP 100/70 HR 94 RR 17 with sat 100 on 3L NC. Toxic
   appearing, c/o RLE pain. JVD elevated Labs notable for WBC 4.8K, HCT
   45, K+ 4.8, Cr 5.8, lactate 5.6, TB 3.9. CXR with RLL collapse, EKG s
   acute changes.
   Agree with plan to manage mild respiratory insufficiency and leg pain
   with RLE USG to r/o DVT. If present, would favor filter, given multiple
   risks for bleeding with coumadin. Will manage RLL collapse and possible
   pneumonia with sputum GS/C+S, Legionella UCx, and induced sputum for
   PCP/[**Doctor First Name **]. Unclear if there is an infection at this time, but will cover
   for CAP, skin and possible bowel sources while awaiting culture data
   and abd/pelvic CT for focal collection. Given AIDS, will consult ID,
   and given elevated enzymes and prior endocarditis with paravalvular
   [**Last Name (LF) 2400**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] recheck echo. His liver function is worse than prior,
   unclear if this is due to viral infection, drugs / tylenol, congestion,
   or low flow. Will follow serial studies and d/w liver team after
   imaging. Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

   HPI:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 6961**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6962**] is a 31 y.o. F with history of abnormal pap smear
   with colpo in [**2148**], on OCPs and an intermittent smoker, who presents
   with L calf pain that started 1.5 weeks ago.  She had just started
   running and thought her pain was due to tendinitis.  She took tylenol
   which helped initially but the the pain got worse.  L calf pain was
   worse at night and first thing in the AM.  Usually [**2151-4-8**], but today,
   it was [**2151-9-13**].  She took a bath in Epsom salts which helped a little
   bit.  She also noted increasing SOB that started about 1 week ago with
   feeling dyspneic after talking, walking on flat surfaces or going up
   stairs.  On day of admission, she was walking to her car when she
   syncopized 3 times with brief episodes of LOC.  She denied CP or
   palpitations prior to these episodes, but did note + dizziness and
   lightheadedness.  She called her brother and mom on her cell, who then
   called EMS and she was brought to the ED via ambulance.
   .
   In the ED, initial VS: BP 89/74  HR 106  RR 24  95% on NRB. Per ED
   resident, A&O x 3.  Labs were drawn, which were significant for
   leukocytosis of 15.3 and ARF of 1.2.  ED performed bedside U/S that
   showed right sided hypokinesis.  EKG with R heart strain.  CT head and
   CTA performed.  CTA with bilateral pulmonary embolism.  Guiaic negative
   in ED.  Given persistent hypotension, pt started on alteplase in ED.
   Post-thromybolysis VS improved wth BP 110-142/70-82.

   OCPs and an intermittent smoker, who presents with hypotension, syncope
   x 3, found to have bilateral pulmonary embolism.
   .
   # Pulmonary Embolism: Seen on CTA today.  Likely seconday to OCP and
   intermittent smoking use.  Per mother and patient, no 1st or 2nd
   generation family members with history of clotting or bleeding
   disorders or frequent miscarriages.  Patient s/p thrombolytic therapy
   with normalization of vital signs.  Currently on RA, no longer
   tachycardic to 110s and SBP 120-140s
   - Given large hematoma on R elbow exacerbated by alteplase, will hold
   heparin gtt for now pending vascular srugery input
   - Ideally would like to start heparin gtt and then transition to
   coumadin for 3-6 months
   - Neuro checks q 1 hours x 24 hours due to alteplase
   - Wean NC as tolerated for O2 > 93%
   - Will need to address smoking and OCP use during this hospitalization
   .
   # Multiple hematomas: Large R elbow hematoma with smaller hematomas on
   R cheek and R knee which were exacerbated by alteplase. Would like to
   start systemic anticoagualation, but also need to be concerned for
   expanding hematomas and potential for compartment syndrome particularly
   in RUE
   - active T&S
   - q 8 hour Hcts
   - consult vascular surgery for input regarding anticoagulation given
   large R elbow hematoma
   - pressure dressings on hematomas as well as ice
   - keep RUE elevated
   - monitor pulses and strength in RUE, RLE frequently
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Cr elevated to 1.2 today from normal baseline
   0.8-0.9, does not appear overtly dry, but will try fluid challenge
   - 1 L NS
   - recheck Cr in AM
   - renally dose medications
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Likely secondary to stress response to PE
   - monitor
   - CIS
   .
   FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / regular diet

   diastolic CHF, Afib, and chronic GI bleeding admitted with recurrent GI
   bleeding and hypotension.
   # GI bleed: Currently GIB bleed appears slowed and chronic.  His blood
   pressure has rapidly normalized following 1L of saline and 2 units of
   pRBCs.  most likely source of bleeding is small AVM in upper GI tract
   but no definitive testing has been done to date.  Bleeding likely
   exacerbated in the setting of dual anti-platelet agents. Given advanced
   age and extensive coronary disease, EGD or c-scope would be of
   increased risk.
   - Hct check q6 until stable
   - guaiac stools
   - primary GI doc contact[**Name (NI) **] --- [**Name2 (NI) 5342**] Hcts, outpatient follow up
   - H. pylori serology, and treat if positive

   - PPI IV bid for now
   # Coronary Artery Disease: no evidence of acute ischemia with unchanged
   EKG and no elevation in cardiac enzymes.  presentation not consistent
   with ACS.
   - tele
   - contact primary cardiologist
   - aspirin 81 mg daily
   - hold plavix for now

 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old lady with hypotension and radiographic evidence of
   pneumonia now two days out from rehab after a CABG. She is comfortable
   at this time.
   1. Hypotension: Has not required pressors.  Most likely source seems to
   be hypovolemia.
   - stop heprin
   - continue antibiotics
   Possible etiologies of hypotension include poor PO intake and
   hypovolemia (as supported by history) or sepsis from a Pneumonia as
   supported by elevated WBC and radiographic findings.  Levaquin already
   administed in ED and she is on her 3rd Liter of NS at the time of this
   note.  Non-invasive blood pressures difficult to obtain due to
   tremulousness. She is making ~ 20mL urine per hour.  Other
   possibilities include recent MI or possible PE or obstructing renal
   stone causing pyelonephritis.
   - Broaden antibiotic coverage to Vanc/Cefepime now, renally dosed.
   Cipro to start in 48 hours
   - Rule out Flu with DFA; precautions
   - Sputum cultures
   - Continue NS to urine output and goal SBP >100; MAP>65
   - Monitor BPs this AM, place arterial line (technically challenging
   given tremor) if monitoring becomes difficult or BPs remain low
   - Regular heart healthy diet
   - Hold metoprolol, Lisinopril and Lasix & amiodarone
   - Start heparin gtt, LENIs, VQ Scan
   - Echo
   - Renal U/S
   2. (HC vs. Hospital Acquired) Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic
   evidence of a RLL PNA, HAP versus HCAP given history with associated
   left sided pleuritic pain.  She denies cough or fever.
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro as above
   - ABG to monitor respiratory status although she is satting well and
   not dyspneic
   3. Delirium with tremulousness: The patient has developed waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status in the past 24 hours per family report.  She has
   also developed new tremor at this time.  Her tremulousness can be due
   to new medications (Compazine) or neurontin overdose in the setting
   over worsening renal failure.  A possible neurontin overdose could also
   explain her worsening nausea.
   - Treat underlying infection as above
   - Hold compazine and neurontin
   4. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: The patient's Cr is elevated to 2.8
   with a baseline of 1.1-1.2, still elevated based on her size, weight
   and age.  Likely causes include pre-renal from poor PO intake or ATN
   from hypotension.  Worsening renal failure and subsequent neurontin
   overdose could also synergistically cause her renal failure.
   - Fluid rescussitation, PO Intake
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolyte monitoring
   - Repeat U/A with electrolytes and Urea
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold Lisinopril and Lasix
   5. Anemia: A pre-operative baseline, but worriesome for
   hemoconcentration. Guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding or hemolysis
   given normal LFTs, but thrombocytosis concerning. Normal B12 in
   [**Month (only) 539**]
   - Repeat Hct today
   - Smear, Retic count, iron studies, b12 and folate
   - Type and screen; blood consent
   6. Thrombocytosis: The patient's thrombocytosis could be reactive from
   bleeding/anemia as above; essential or hemoconcentrational.
   - Repeat platelet count
   - Investigate anemia as above, monitor for bleeding
   7. s/p CABG: Complicated by postop atrial fibrillation, currently in
   Sinus. QTc 438.  Elevated Troponin difficult to interpret given renal
   failure; CK elevated from hemolysis
   - Repeat Troponin
   - Hold Amiodarone given hypotension
   - Appreciate CSurg wound care recs
   - Continue ASA, Statin
   8. Arthritis: Patient with chronic pain
   - Tylenol PRN add Tramadol PRN if pain not well controlled
   9. GERD: Continue Omeprazole
   10. Glaucoma: Continue Latanoprost
   FEN: No IVF, Vitamin D, regular diet

   History of present illness: The patient is an 86 y.o. male with pmh
   significant for DM II, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, presenting
   with two episodes of chest pain.  The first episode was [**2-17**] while he
   was clearing snow off of his car.  He experienced 1.5 hours of chest
   tightness followed by vomiting. On [**2-21**] the patient had another episode
   of chest tightness, lasting for 1.5 hours and followed by vomiting.
   This episode occurred while the patient was driving to his volunteer
   work.  A co-worker noticed him vomiting and told him to go to the
   hospital.

 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Patient is a 32M with idiopathic dilatated CM (EF 20%), afib, CVA, SDH,
   and hypothyroidism who is admitted for diuresis and milrinone.
   .
   # PUMP: CHF/Dilated Cardiomyopathy: TTE [**8-3**] showed EF 20%, diagnosed
   after presenting with Class III CHF symptoms in [**9-27**], thought to be
   viral etiology, s/p AICD. His dry weight is 100 kg, currently below dry
   weight at 93kg. Had recent admission at OSH where he presented with LE
   swelling and received IV lasix.  Currently does not appear volume
   overloaded, JVP flat, lungs clear and only trace edema. Plan as
   outlined by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]:
   - Inc. BB to 200mg tid given arrythmogenic effects of milrinone
   - Milrinone bolus of 50mcg/kg, followed by infusion 0.25mcg/kg/min, can
   titrate up to 0.75mcg/kg/min.
   - Maintain SBP>80, MAP>40
   - continue digoxin
   - Holding torsemide for now, will consider lasix gtt for diuresis if BP
   remains stable on milrinone.
   - holding ace-i for now, can consider starting in am
   - SW consult for possible milrinone therapy at home
   .
   # RHYTHM: Chronic atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin, diagnosed in the
   setting of hyperthyroidism. Coumadin held [**Date range (1) 2788**] s/p SDH.
   - holding coumadin given INR supratherapeutic, restart once INR<2.5
   - uptitrate metoprolol as above
   .
   # h/o Ventricular Tachycardia: first noted in [**9-27**], had non sustained
   30 second run seen on Holter [**8-29**], s/p syncope from VT in [**9-1**].
   - monitor on telemetry
   - ICD in place
   - maintain K >4, Mg >2
   .
   # NEURO: s/p CVA as well as SDH. On Keppra for sz prophylaxis.
   Admitted to OSH in [**9-2**] after seizure at home and he was started on
   Keppra. Has been seizure free.
   - Cont Keppra 250mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Thyroid dysfunction: Originally had hyperthyroidism, secondary to
   Amiodarone (d/ced [**3-1**]), s/p prednisone and methimazole-->
   hypothyroidism
   -continue synthroid
   .
   # CRI: Baseline Cr 1.7-1.8, currently as baseline.  Likely related to
   poor forward flow.
   - Cont to follow with diuresis
   - renally dose meds

   able to perform these activities without symptoms.  Noted after
   awakening the AM prior to admission.  Persistent symptoms and
   associated anterior chest discomfort and interscapular back pain.
   Persistence of DOE sypmtoms (without improvement) throughout day
   prompted pt to seek medical attention --> dauthter called EMS.  Pt.
   decribed symptoms as that similar to prior episode of CAD.  During EMS
   transport, received ASA & nitroglycerin with considerable relief of
   chest discomfort.  Transported to [**Hospital1 19**]

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pulmonary emboli, bilateral.
   PULMONARY EMBOLI -- suggested by CTA.  Will await final review.
   Unclear predisposition, but evidence for right LE swelling on current
   exam.  Possible role for recent use of knee brace.  Continue heparin,
   maintain PTT >60-80.  Consider LE NIVS.  WOuld perform cardiac echo to
   assess chamber size and function, estimate PA pressures.  Consider
   chronic recurrent pulmonary emboli.  No indication for acute
   thrombolysis at this time.
   DYSPNEA -- attributed to hypoxemia and pulmonary emboli.  [**Month (only) 51**] have
   pulmonary hypertension.  Monitor RR, SaO2.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to shunt & VQ mismatch.
   CHEST DISCOMFORT -- resolved.  Likey due to pulmonary emboli, but may
   be demand ischemia (hypoxemia).  Monitor.
   RIGHT CALF GIRTH -- check LE NIVS.  Would persue thrombophillia w/u
   (ex. Protein C, Protein S, anti PL antibody, etc)
   HTN -- stable.  Monitor BP.
   DM -- hyperglycemia.  [**Month (only) 51**] require insulin to maintain glucose <150.

   I saw and examined this pt, and was present with the ICU team for the
   key portions of services provided. I agree with the note above, and
   would add: 58 YO female w.severe asthma, pulm HTN, morbid obesity s/p
   bariatric surgery, chronically on 3 liters n.c. oxygen. In today to see
   her PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u, during which she had O2 sats of 85% on 3lnc. Pt has
   had cough with white sputum for the past day, but otherwise had felt
   her breathing to at baseline. She had recently completed a course of
   prednisone for asthma flair.
   In the ED, her sats were 68% on 2.5 liters, T 98.6, R 30, BP 138/66.
   Placed on NRB and sent to ICU. CXR unremarkable, got nebs/solumedrol.
   EKG with TWI 3, avF
   Her PMHx includes [**Name Initial (PRE) 8503**]/OSA on BiPAP 18/15 and 3-4 liters oxygen at
   night, Pulmonary HTN /cor pulmonale,
   Asthma, HTN and OA
   Exam
   Obese female, comfortable, talkative, 145/94, 94% on 2lnc and 50% venti
   mask
   Lungs: diffuse crackles bilaterally, no wheezes
   CV: RRR
   Abdomen: obese, mild peri-umbilical tenderness without
   guarding/rebound, +bs, ecchymoses from prior heparin injections
   Ext: bilateral boots, calves nontender, trace edema
   WBC 8.8
   HCO3 42
   CK's negative
   CXR with cardiomegaly but no obvious infiltrates/effusions
   Imp: 1. Acute respiratory distress/hypoxia: pt not complaining of
   dyspnea. Her diuretics were recently decreased and it is possible that
   there is a component of mild fluid overload. With her recent cough, she
   alternatively could  have a URI/bronchospasm (not wheezing currently,
   but just received a nebulizer treatment).
    Plan inhalers, ABG, torsemide (goal -500cc negative fluid balance) but
   no antibiotics for now, check ABG
   For OSA/[**Last Name (LF) 8503**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] resume BiPAP at home settings of 18/15 with 3-4
   liters oxygen
   2. Abdominal pain: appears chronic with negative abd CT scan last
   admission. Will monitor with further intervention.
   3 EKG changes: reportedly, new TWI in 3 and AVF (unable to find EKG).
   Doubt thrombotic process as pt
s cath in [**2120**] did not show significant
   CAD but will cycle cardiac enzymes and continue ASA.
    Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 40 minutes.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 87 year old female with chronic renal insufficiency presenting
   with acute on chronic renal failure, hyperkalemia and a UTI.
   1. Acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency: history highly
   suggestive of a pre-renal/ATN process given infection and poor po
   intake. She had a baseline creatinine of 1.7-2/Creatinine Cl of 25 in
   [**Month (only) 2139**]. Renal evaluated the patient in the ED.  Sediment not
   consistent with acute GN. Currently complicated by hyperkalemia and
   metablic acidosis (see below). No evidence of volume overload (appears
   dry-euvolemic)
   -Check urine creatinine, sodium, urea to calculate FeNa and FeUrea
   -Renal ultrasound without hydronephrosis
   -D5 with 3 amps bicarb at 100 cc/hr as per renal
   -Decisions re: HD per renal team, as long as hyperkalemia and acidosis
   remain treatable, no plan for HD tonight.
   -Patient receives most care at VA, obtain prior values in am.
   2. Hyperkalemia: treated with multiple agents in ED including
   Kayexelate, D50/Insulin, bicarbonate and calcium gluconate. Evidence of
   peak T-wave in V2 only.  Expect baseline potassium of 5.5, goal <6.0
   for tonight.
   -Serial potassium
   -Monitor for BM, if not, repeat Kayexelate, holding lasix
   -D5 with 3 amps bicarbonate for fluid
   -prn D50/insulin
   -Contact renal for HD if unable to control/improve values
   -ECG at ICU admission
   3. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: from acute renal failure.  Will
   monitor calcium closely as acidosis improves. Per renal, in this
   setting, rapid correction of acidosis can lead to hypocalcemia and
   seizure.
   -D5 with 3 amps bicarb at 100 cc/hr. If evidence of volume overload,
   will need to change to bolus bicarbonate
   -Follow bicarbonate level q4h with electrolytes
   -Follow calcium/ionized calcium level with electrolytes
   4. UTI/Pyelonephritis: with leukocytosis, hypothermia at admission--no
   blood cultures drawn in ED.  The patient has multiple antibiotic
   alleriges. Unknown prior micro data. Had CVA tenderness on exam
   concerning for pyelonephritis.  No e/o abscess on renal ultrasound
   -Aztreonam 2g IV q8h overnight
   -Follow urine culture, send blood cultures
   5. Chest pain: ? related to PAF given fleeting nature (see below) vs.
   ischemia vs. GERD/nausea vs. other. Notes indicate chest pain may be a
   chronic issue for the patient, she is on long acting nitrate
   -Complete ROMI
   -Continue aspirin, statin, beta blocker, isordil, SL NTG prn
   -PPI, antacids prn
   -Monitor on telemetry
   6. Hyponatremia: likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.  Has a history of
   hyponatremia per VA records, but actual lab values not available ([**5-23**]
   was 135).
   -Recheck with ICU admission labs, if worsening, check urine/serum osm,
   urine sodium
   7. Normocytic anemia: unclear baseline--but current level similar to
   [**2109-5-16**] value. Expect that she has chronic anemia related to renal
   insufficiency and chronic disease.
   -Stool guaiac
   -Iron studies
   -Trend
   8. Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation: Initial ECG irregular without P
   waves in ED, upon arrival in ICU in NSR by ECG.  AF with SVR during ED
   course.  The patient has had 2 TIAs-most recent in [**5-23**]. She has known
   carotid stenosis and history of poorly controlled hypertension which
   add to her overall stroke risk. CHADS2 score is 4 and she should be
   anticoagulated. On Atenolol as outpatient.
   9. Hypertension: continue catapres, amlodipine and atenolol. Will need
   to hold Diovan and Lasix in the setting of ARF.
   10. Patellar fracture: PT consult, pain control with Tylenol
   11. FEN: NPO for now, electrolytes as above. Continue folate for h/o
   hyperhomocystinemia
   12. Prophylaxis: on HSQ as outpt, but VA notes indicate heparin
   allergy.  Will continue HSQ and PPI given stomch upset

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  87 yo F NH resident, new to [**Hospital1 19**], with PMH
   of htn, TIAs and CRI presents with 1 wk of nausea and
   vomiting/intermittent CP, poor PO intake. Evaluated by Urban Med group
   and found to be in acute on CRF (cr 7.6, bun 150's) with hyperkalemia
   to 8-->sent to ED. Per VA records cr was 1.7 in [**Month (only) 51**]. In ED was
   hypothermic 95.6, BP stable, and sats 98% on NC.  ECG showed a-fib
   (?new) with peaked TW in v2.  Received insulin, D50, sodium bicarb,
   kayexalate.  Renal consulted. K improved to 6.6.  Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for
   management.
   Labs on admit also notable for: wbc 12.6, hct 31.9 (b/l), plt 204 , na
   130, ck 42, trop 0.03, alb 4.2, K-->8.3--> 6.7, u/a +
   Urine and blood cx sent and pending.
   Overnight- -> continued to treat hyperK w/ bicarb gtt with lab
   improvement.  Started on aztreonam for UTI (multiple drug allergies)-->
   ID called and suggested ceftaz challenge to treat.
   Exam notable for T 98.2 BP 152/48 HR 58  RR 17 with sat 100%
   on 1L-->RA .
   Alert F in AND, tremulous with asterixis.  sym chest wall excursion, no
   weheze,RR no rub, benign abd,  L leg in immobilizer, warm extremities,

   FENA 5, ionized ca 1.2
   CXR without focal process
   Renal u/s--atrophic L kidney, no hydro R kidney, cyst no mass, no
   obvious abscess noted
   ecg --afib, peaked T v2 TWI 3, flat TWs--> peaked TW in V2 resolved,,
   NSR
   TTE,  [**2109-5-16**]--diastolic dysfx, neg pfo by bubble study
   Active issues include:
   #ARF on CRI--hx and exam appears most c/w prerenal state; Has stage 4
   ckd at baseline.  Renal following--no acute HD incication though uremic
   with very elevated BUN (n/v/tremor/asterixis, but no rub).
   # Hyperkalemia--in setting of acute on CRI, improved with medical
   management
   # AG metabolic acidosis --> improving with bicarb gtt, monitoring for
   hypocalcemia with correction
   # A-fib/h/o TIAs--paroxysmal, appears to be new, as no known prior hx
   and has had extensive TIA w/u in past per records. Suspect this may be
   etiology of pt
s intermittent chest discomfort though she is pain free
   at this time. Continue MI r/o by CEs.  Recent echo ([**Month (only) 51**]) with
   relatively preserved fx.  CHADs score elevated and would
   anticoagulate.  Will hold on heparin pending decision about HD and ened
   for line placement.  Will also assess for falls risk (urban med gr and
   NH)
   #Htn--Continue home med regimen of statin, BB, asa, nitro.
   # Leukocytosis/UTI--likely [**2-16**] UTI, was hypothermic in ed, now
   normothermic.  Remains HD stable.  Will f/u cx data and trial ceftaz
   challenge to treat UTI.
   # Hyponatremia--resolved
   # Anemia--iron studies c/w ACD with known CRI--additional drop in H/h
   likely dilutional after aggressive hydration--will follow and heme
   check stool
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

   apparent suicide attempt.
   .
   Plan:
   # Toxic ingestion: Patient currently with stable vitals, but somnolent
   and unresponsive.  Primarily sounds like Ambien and benztropine
   overdose and clinical picutre fits with sedatives.  Reason for patient
   to have benztropine prescription is unknown.  Cocaine was positive on
   tox screen, however, patient is does not show other signs of cocaine
   intoxication.

   - re-send acetaminophen and ASA levels.
   - Supportive care (O2, cardiac monitoring, IVF as needed) until patient
   becomes alert or family can be contact[**Name (NI) **].
   - Psychiatry consult for SI when more alert.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo F with CAD, diastolic HCF, HTN, OSA who presents with lethargy
   and hypercapneic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercapneic respiratory failure: Hypercarbic on ABG and decreased
   respiratory rate likely secondary to narcotic overdose given pt was
   sedated but woke up with narcan and was on narcan gtt.  This was
   stopped later the evening of admission. Pt had not signs of opioid
   withdrawal.  No opioids on tox screen but oxycodone does not always
   show up on screen.
   -decrease sedating meds by d/c percocet and renally dosing gabapentin.
   Supplement with Tylenol for pain control.
   -continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   -continue CPAP at night
   -no need for psych consult as not intentional over dose
   -consider SW consult to look into med administration and to address
   multiple admission.
   .
   # Lethargy: Most likely [**2-12**] narcotics overdose given positive urine and
   serum levels (including acetaminophen from percocet), and response to
   narcan. Also, may be component of hypercapnia.  Pt had no meningeal
   signs, fever, leukocytosis to indicate meningitis. No LP was done.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   also be [**2-12**] uremia with increased BUN/Cr.  CT of the head was negative
   for bleed.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC elevated to 12.4 which is new since [**4-21**]. Pt was
   afebrile.   CXR was negative. Pt was treated for UTI during recent
   admission however UA was + for only trace leukocytes, few bacteria, mod
   bili, and trace ketones.  No current diarrhea and abd exam benign. WBC
   normalized by the morning after admission and no antibiotics were
   started. She is at higher risk [**2-12**] immunosuppression from steroids
   given treatment for RA. Also has eosinophilia of unknown etiology and
   should have further work up as outpatient.
   -f/u urine cx
   -obtain blood cx
   -trend eosinophils
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Was hypervolemic on exam on admission
   but her CXR was without symptoms of pulmonary edema.  However,  patient
   has never had CXR signs of fluid overload in past admissions for
   decompensated CHF. She has an elevated proBNP.  Pt got 40 IV lasix in
   the ED with good output.  Her dry weight is 230 but she was 242 after
   discharge on [**4-21**].  Weight on admission was 246kg.  Current oxygen
   requirement is 2L NC.  She was diuresed while in the ICU.
   -diuresis goal 3-4 L today
   -no ACE as history of hyperkalemia
   -TTE to reassess change in cardiac function
   -can consider cards consult if other workup negative
   .
   # acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Her baseline Cr is likely 1.5.
    On [**4-21**] her creatinine was 2.2.  On admission her creatinine was 3.4
   which trended down to 2.3.
   -trend creatinine especially given continuing diuresis
   .
   # Tylenol overdose: Likely from tylenol component of Percocet
   indicating increased use of narcotics contributing to lethargy above.
   She has no known liver disease in past. Her Tylenol level did not
   require NAC or activated charcoal.
   - pt likely will need Tylenol for pain control and thus needs good
   teaching prior to discharge
   # OSA and mild obstructive lung disease: On CPAP at home [**12-15**].
   -Continue CPAP when sleeping
   .
   # CAD s/p MI and stent:  Pt CKs trended up and then down.  Troponin
   peak at 0.04.  MB index was positive. EKG was unchanged from prior.
   Likely demand ischemia in setting of hypercarbic respiratory therapy.
   -monitor on telemetry
   -restart ASA, statin, beta blockers
   ..
   # anemia: HCT at baseline.
   .
   # DM2:
   -ISS
   .
   # depression:
   -continue citalopram
   .
   # hypothyroidism:
   -continue synthroid
   .
   # rheumatoid arthritis/neuropathy/shoulder pain:
   -see above for pain control
   .
   # FEN:
   -low salt/diabetic & fluid restriction to 1L daily
   -replete k>4, mg>2 and check afternoon lytes given diuresis
   .
   # PPX:
   -heparin SQ for DVT ppx
   -PPI per home reg
   .
   #. Social issues: Patient with multiple hospitalizations in last year,
   unclear social situation at home, but should work on addressing this
   cycle of admissions - providing support, or address rehab/care issues
   - SW consult

s. Pupils 3-4mm, briskly reactive, equal. Speech is slurred,
   sometimes inappropriate, often does not answer correct question.  Pt
   does not seem to be having aphasia.  See metavision for details.  BP

   sat decreases during episodes of bradycardia.  HR usually 60-70, NSR,
   but also seen 90-110 afib upon admission. Pt having rare PVCs.
   Action:
   Labetalol gtt started to control HTN; NBP continued with arterial line
   monitoring d/t ?accuracy and to watch closely per HO.  EKG obtained d/t
   bradycardic events. Labetalol gtt stopped d/t BP within goal (100-140
   systolic) and to switch to nicardipine if needed for BP control to
   avoid bradycardic episodes.  Repeat Head CT obtained at 06:40.

   withdrawal and displaced left humeral fracture but reports resuming
   heavy EtOH use 8 days ago in the setting the drowning death of 15-yo
   daughter from a diving accident on [**8-18**]. He reports drinking
   approximately 2 pints of vodka daily for the past 8 days with his last
   drink was reportedly Friday night. Pt developed left chest pressure 3
   days ago accompanied by diaphoresis, nausea, shortness of breath, and
   left arm pain; no lightheadedness. He reports being at rest when this
   occurred although he was upset about his daughter's death. He presented
   to the ED for ongoing chest pressure. He was given ASA 325mg by EMS as
   well as NTG x 2 with some relief.

   In the ED, patient reported to have a brief unresponsive episode with
   quick recovery. ECG in ED initially with sinus tachy to 106 with
   question of isolated ST depression in III. CXR with low lung volumes.
   CTA without PE or aortic dissection but notable for small hematoma
   around minimally displaced left clavicular head fracture. Labs
   significant for EtOH level 270 and anion gap of 17. He also had a K of
   5.6 on a hemolyzed sample; given kayexalate. He was intermittently
   hypertensive and treated for EtOH withdrawal, receiving a total of
   valium 20mg IV and ativan 5mg IV along with banana bag x 1 L and NS IVF
   x 5 L. Also given Zofran for nausea, tylenol and morphine for pain. He
   was admitted to the MICU for further management. VS on transfer: T

   .
   CTA chest (prelim): No PE seen. Minimally displaced fracture of the
   left clavicular head with small surrounding hematoma. Adjacent vascular
   structures remain patent and intact.
   ECG: Sinus tach at 106 bpm, 1mm ST scooping in III which appears
   similar to prior ECG from [**2175-6-4**]. Rate improved with Less pronounced
   ST scooping on subsequent ECGs.
   Assessment and Plan
   34 yo M with h/o alcohol abuse who presents with chest pain and L
   clavicular head fracture, admitted to MICU for EtOH withdrawal.
   EtOH withdrawal: Bingedrinking in setting of daughter's death with last
   drink reportedly 24-36 hours prior to presentation to ED. Currently in
   withdrawal controlled with po valium. Pt reports not wanting to drink;
   has AA sponsor and wishes to return to outpatient program.
   - Valium 10mg prn for CIWA >10
   - MVI, thiamine, folate
   - Serum tox negative; urine tox ordered
   - SW consulted
   Chest pain: Most likely musculoskeletal given ecchymoses, TTP, and
   visualized clavicular fracture; pt does not recall fall but has been
   intoxicated from EtOH abuse. Constellation of nausea, diaphoresis, and
   shortness of breath concerning for cardiac etiology with EKG baseline
   with neg cardiac enzymes x 2. [**Month (only) 8**] be exacerbated by grief/adjustment
   disorder, ddx. panic attack. Could also be complicated by EtOH
   withdrawal.
   - F/u final CTA chest read
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - EKG in AM
   - Management of fracture per Ortho recs
   - Management of EtOH withdrawal as above
   - Pain management as below
   - Psych consult
   Grief/adjustment disorder: Pt reports feelings of depression and guilt
   in setting of daughter's death.
   - SW consulted and recommend psychiatric consult
   Left clavicular fx: Evidence of small hematoma around minimally
   displaced fracture of the left clavicular head.
   - Conservative management per Ortho curbside with sling, non weight
   bearing status in LUE
   - Monitor Hct
   - F/u final CTA chest read
   - Tylenol, lidoderm patch, and initially on morphine prn for pain
   management but given h/o pruritis, will switch to Fentanyl patch with
   Fentanyl boluses prn for breakthrough
   - Ortho consult to see today and staff in AM
   Left humeral fracture: Presented with this in [**5-18**] and conservatively
   managed.
   - Given persistent pain and ecchymoses, will reimage
   - Sling as above
   - Resume ortho f/u and PT as outpatient
   Anion gap metabolic acidosis and metabolic alkalosis: Likely [**3-13**]
   alcoholic and starvation ketosis. Metabolic alkalosis may be in setting
   of nausea/vomiting. Has received 6+ L of hydration since arrival to ED
   - Encourage po intake
   - Add on serum osm, urine Cl
   - PM lytes
   - Cont NS IV fluids at 100 cc/h until taking po and pending improvement
   in gap
   Transaminitis: AST predominance suggestive of EtOH as etiology. No
   abdominal pain or organomegaly palpated.
   - Trend for now; consider further work-up if not normalizing
   Thrombocytopenia: Likely due to bone marrow suppression from EtOH
   abuse.
   - Trend plt
   - Holding hep SC for now but start for DVT ppx if plt count improving
   on repeat labs
   Hypertension: Cont CIWA scale for withdrawal as well as home amlodipine
   5mg.

   note in the doorway which was still there on [**10-11**].  She then called
   maintenance at his living facility to break into his apartment.  Found
   minimally responsive.  Incontinent of urine.  ? next to bottle of
   vicodin (unclear if he took this).  Brought to [**Hospital 327**] hospital;
   notable lab findings include K 8, bicarb of 6 and pH 7.00.  CXR and
   head CT reportedly negative.  He received sodium bicarb.  EtOH was
   negative as was other tox screen.
   .
   In the ED, patient confused, oriented x 1 only but alert and protecting
   airway.  Afebrile, P86 126/57, R12, 100% on ?.  Labs reveal severe
   nongap metabolic acidosis (ABG 7.00/25/122 with chem 7 bicarb of 7 and
   anion gap of 11).  In our ED he received 2 liters of IV fluids,
   dextrose and insulin, 1 amp bicarb.  Reportedly putting out excellent
   urine.  Tox consulted in ED; prelim recs include no NAC given negative
   level and likely timecourse.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   66 M with unclear PMH, found unresponsive at home; found to have severe
   nongap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, likely acute renal failure.
   .
   # Severe metabolic acidosis.  Normal AG of 10.  Tox screen negative.
   Common AG acidosis triggers negative (lactate and ketones).
   Methanol/Eth glycol less likely, as would expect anion gap but will
   check levels and would be reasonable to start fomepizole per toxicology
   recs.  Regarding non-gap etiologies; ARF seems most likely.  No
   evidence of GI losses.  Respiratory compensation only slightly
   suboptimal (mild relative respiratory acidosis).
   - sodium bicarb in D5W
   - appreciate tox recs
   - consider start fomepizole, 15mg/kg IV loading dose.
   - send methanol and ethylene glycol levels STAT to [**Hospital1 1910**] (per tox).
   - ARF workup and management as detailed below.
   - serum osmolality for osmol gap
   .
   # Altered mental status.  Most likely toxic metabolic given the above.
   Possibility of ingestions, tox negative, getting toxic alcohols as
   above.  CT head read as without acute process per OSH ED records.  LFTs
   normal.  No role for NAC per tox (given negative level and normal
   LFTs).  He appears to be protecting his airway.
   - follow
   - avoid sedating meds
   .
   # Renal failure. Acute vs. acute on chronic.  Baseline unknown.  Has
   reported history of obstruction so postrenal is a possibility.
   Intrarenal still on differential as is prerenal considering his unknown
   length of time down.
   - Obtain baselines
   - urine lytes
   - renal u/s
   - trend creatinine
   - nephrology aware, will see in AM.
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Positive UA. unclear anatomy. ? ileum serving as bladder, in which
   case significance of pyuria is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] is afebrile and HD stable.
   - hold on antibiotics for now unless fevers, etc
   - gather info on anatomy and past urologic procedures
   - consider urology consult
   .
   # Hyperkalemia. no acute EKG changes.  Suspect he will not cooperate
   with kayexalate.
   - trend K, if worsens/develops EKG changes, can consider insulin, etc.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Free water deficit roughly 3-4 L.
   - free water repletion.
   .
   # Anemia. mild, unclear baseline.
   - follow
   .
   # hx of HTN. unknown if currently treated.
   - no antihypertensives for now as not significantly hypertensive
   - medication reconciliation.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 y/o man with PMH notable for alcoholic cirrhosis admitted
   with abdominal pain/distension in setting of SMV thrombus and now
   transferred to MICU with hypotension/bradycardia and altered mental
   status.
   .
   # Hypotension/bradycardia: Improved after dosing of glucagon and likely
   related to decreased clearance of nadolol in setting of worsening renal
   failure. With hematocrit drop, also could be due to volume depletion
   with blood loss. Concern also for sepsis, but source unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 133**]
   investigate abdomen as potential source with CT abdomen/pelvis.
   Paracentesis on arrival to ICU not consistent with SBP.
   - redose glucagon prn, could add drip
   - repeat lactate once bps improved
   - hold all beta blockade
   - CT abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for bleeding source or ? colitis
   - follow blood cultures, paracentesis cultures
   .
   # Altered mental status: Could be related to hypotension or new
   infection (intraabdominal versus bacteremia). Appears to have been
   taking lactulose for past few days but hepatic encephalopathy certainly
   on the differential.
   - CT head without contrast
   - follow studies for SBP
   - hold lactulose for now (no NG tube due to recent banding of varices)
   - repeat RUQ ultrasound to eval for portal vein thrombosis
   .
   # Anemia: Hct down 10 points over 24 hours with hypotension. Has known
   varices with banding several days ago.
   - check hemolysis labs, Coombs test
   - hold all antihypertensives
   - 2 U PRBCs on arrival to the ICU
   - post-transfusion hct this afternoon
   - guaiac stools
   - CT abdomen/pelvis to eval for hemoperitoneum
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Concerning for hepatorenal syndrome. Urine lytes
   this morning with urine sodium < 10.
   - albumin 100 g daily X 2 days
   - consider midodrine/octreotide
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Improving since admission. Off of diuretics. Continue
   to trend.
   .
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: MELD now 31 with today's labs. Recent SMV
   thrombosis on scan, with heparin gtt as described above, which is now
   off.
   - trend LFTs
   - continue lactulose, may need NG tube for dosing
   - RUQ ultrasound and CT abd/pelvis as above
   .
   # Type 2 DM: sliding scale insulin. while not eating, will need some
   lantus coverage (1/2 dose of 45 units given while eating).
   .
   # Hypertension: hold all antihypertensives for now
   .
   # COPD: continue albuterol prn
   .
   # FEN: npo for now, lyte repletion prn
   .
   # PPx: pneumoboots, ppi, can use lactulose prn
   .

   79-year-old man is admitted to the ICU last night with
   hypercarbic/hypoxemia respiratory failure. Recent history of AAA repair
   c/b ischemic bowel, wound dehiscence, colectomy, fungemia, trach, and
   PEG (since decannulated) all over the past few months, and a chronic
   history of 3VD.  Admitted to floor with desaturations and low-grade
   temps as well as delirium.  Had been recently started on Remeron per
   notes.  A CXR was interpreted as LLL PNA and he received levoflox.  ABG
   baseline was 7.47/43/77 on uncertain FiO2.
   Admitted to MICU with delirium, hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure.
   Afebrile.
   Failed BIPAP with worsening of hypercarbic failure. ABG 7.28 / 74 / 73
   7.16 / 91 / 136 on BIPAP
   Mild leukocytosis.
   Intubated, post-intubation hypotension which seemed to be med-related
   and was volume-responsive.
   Treated empirically for pneumonia.
   AC 0.5/550/16/5
   7.47/40/136 on 0.5, A-a DO2 ~180
   I/O 300/550
   CTA neg for PE but sig for pleural effusions left > right with
   compressive atelectasis on left. Parenchyma appears normal.
   Vanc/zosyn/levo [**6-2**] (levo stopped and restarted yest for poss
   legionella)
   Key issues:
   79-year old man with
   1.       Respiratory failure (hypercarbic and hypoxemic) with no clear
   explanation. Had been breathing in a rapid, shallow pattern for hours
   prior to intubation. Being treated for possible pna though CT only
   suggests small compressive atelectasis/consolidation on left. Mild
   leukocytosis with left shift.
   a.       V/Q mismatch from pleural effusions
   b.       Possible PNA, though radiographically underwhelming
   c.        Malacia or tracheal lesion related to prior intubation/trach
   d.       CNS
   2.       Delirium (pre-intubation)
   3.       Anemia
   4.       Complex background history
   a.       Peripheral vascular disease
   b.       Aortic vascular disease
   c.        Coronary arterial disease
   d.       Fungemia ([**2201-3-8**])
   e.       Complex pleural issues (pigtail catheter during recent
   hospitalization)
   In addition, fever is low grade (100.4), leucocytosis is mild, and
   bandemia is absent.  Clinically, does not appear to have marked COPD.
   Therefore:
   1)       Treat for health-care-associated pneumonia.  Get good
   cultures.  Would use meropenem since (a) prior Klebs and (b) has been
   exposed to abx in interim.  Cover MRSA and atypicals, as well.
   2)       Left thoracentesis
   3)       Bronch to evaluate airways including trachea, get good cx
   4)       Echocardiogram to evaluate LVEF, RVEF, and valves
   (?endocarditis given past fungemia)
   Hypotension has improved close to baseline with volume repletion.
   Total time spent:  45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill.

   was admitted to LGH for NSTEMI. While admitted she remained painfree
   for several days. Cardiology was consulted the next day and recommended
   cardiac cath as in retrospect it seemed that the multifocal PNA may
   have been acute CHF exacerbation that could have been related to
   ischemia. Therefore the patient was started on heparin gtt, plavix, and
   aspirin and transferred to the LGH CCU to await catheterization. She
   received last dialysis Saturday [**2173-3-27**] (removed 2.6 liters) via left

   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10650**] is a 66 year old gentleman from [**State 5568**] with a history of
   lung cancer s/p right sided lobectomy approximately 6 years ago, and
   history of chronic back pain s/p 2 laminectomies, who presented on
   [**2122-9-2**] to [**Hospital 755**] Hospital with acute back pain. His course was
   notable for progressive high fevers, confusion/altered mental status,
   and a productive cough.
   Outside workup per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note as below:
         L5-S1 central disc protrusion without mass effect or abnormal
   enhancement.
         CT of the head showed diffuse mild cerebral atrophy with no
   evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
         MRI with and without contrast showed no evidence for
   meningitis and no enhancing mass lesion.
         Neurosurgery consultation: recommended no intervention needed
   based on lumbar imaging.
         ID consultation: at that time, no clear signs of infection,
   aside from fevers, so antibiotics had been held. He was treated with
   vanc/ceftriaxone from [**Date range (1) 2110**].
         Neurology consultation
         Lumbar puncture was attempted x 4, with records indicating
   that one attempt may have yielded venous blood.
         Acyclovir was temporarily started and then d/c'd when LP
   fluid was negative for HSV PCR.
         Heme/onc consulted for leukocytosis, bone marrow aspirate on
   [**9-8**] revealed myelodysplasia with no evidence of leukemia.
         Chromosomal and cytogenetic studies were sent.
         Required ICU stay for angioedema of tongue with rash of neck
   and cheek. He did not require intubation, and the angioedema resolved
   with dexamethasone. Dexamethasone started on [**9-6**]
         He developed nodules on his face and neck; biopsies revealed
   neutrophilic dermatosis, c/w Sweet Syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic
   dermatosis
         Found to be hypercalcemic with low albumin levels and ionized
   calcium of 1.61 on day prior to transfer. PTHrP and PTH were sent with
   Vitamin D studies. These were pending at the time of transfer
   He has been at [**Hospital1 19**] for 3 days, and his hospital course thus far is
   notable for repeat lumbar puncture under fluoroscopic guidance which
   was suspected to be complicated by venous or hematoma access, though
   remains unclear. Neurology has recommended cisternal tap.
   His hypercalcemia was managed with IV pamidronate.
   CT scanning of his chest/abdomen revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy,
   pancreatic cysts/nodules concerning for malignancy, and bilateral
   infiltrates concerning for an infectious process. He was started on
   antibiotics:
   - Vancomycin started [**2122-9-17**]

   Echo [**2121-9-18**]
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   EEG [**2121-9-18**]: These findings are suggestive of a mild to moderate
   encephalopathy involving both cortical and subcortical structures

        [image002.jpg]
   Imaging: 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**10/2140**]:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is markedly
   dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right
   ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall
   contractility. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position
   consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+]
   tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-5-13**], the right
   ventricle appears more dilated with severe pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension.
   CARDIAC CATH [**2132**]:
   1. Selective coronary arteriography of this right dominant system
   revealed no significant coronary artery disease. The left main coronary
   artery was normal. The LAD, w/ two diagonal branches had no
   hemodynamically significant lesions. The LCx with a single major OM
   branch was normal. The dominant RCA also had no significant lesions.
   2. Left ventriculography revealed normal systolic function with a
   calculated ejection fraction of 77%.
   3. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided filling pressures
   with a mean RA pressure of 9. There was moderate-to-severe pulmonary
   hypertension with RA pressures of 66/22. Left sided filling pressures
   were mildly elevated with an LVEPD of 20. Cardiac output was above
   normal with a cardiac index of 4.8. SVR was normal at 898, and PVR was
   mildly elevated at 142.
   4. Oxygen saturations revealed a large left-to-right shunt at the level
   of the RA with a step-up of 18% in oxygen saturation from calculated
   mixed venous to RA on 100% NRB. The calculated shunt volume was 17.2
   and the pulmonary/systemic flow ratio was 2.85.
   5. An atrial septal defect was crossed with the PA catheter and
   contrast injection into the left atrium revealed the large ASD w/
   left-to-right flow.
   6. On 100% NRB, the patients oxygenation improved significantly,
   although it did not reach 100% (peak=96%). This may have been due to
   actual inspiration of less than 100% O2 or a small right-to-left shunt.
   Q-eff was caclulated as virtually identical to Q-s, and therefore any
   right-to-left shunting was trivial.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Coronary arteries are normal.
   2. Normal ventricular function.
   3. Large left-to-right shunt via large atrial septal defect.
   4. Moderate-to-severe pulmonary hypertension

   This is a 28yoF 28 [**6-6**] wks pregnant w/h/o asthma, tobacco use, narcotic
   addiction who presents w/ARDS due to progression of bilateral
   s.pneumonia PNA. Per OSH records and signout from OSH pulmonary fellow,
   pt presented to [**Hospital 120**] Hospital ED [**2-16**] w/N/V/myalgias, Fever to
   101.1, chills and productive cough associated w/CP.  There, she was
   found to have CXR c/w BL PNA.  At that time, physicians wanted to admit
   her for treatment of PNA, but she refused admission and was discharged
   AMA w/a Z-pak.  She then presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2-18**]
   w/similar sx including fever/chills and progressive SOB.  She was
   afebrile upon presentation sating 92%on RA.  Gram stain from [**Hospital1 120**]
   was c/w strep pneumo so she was started on Ceftriaxone and duonebs.
   She was also started on Solumedrol 60mg IV q8h w/some improvement in
   her respiratory status. Earlier on the day of admission, pt was
   transferred to OSH ICU where her initial ABG showed 7.41/40/70. She was
   started on NPPV, but she appeared to be tiring. The decision was made
   to intubate the pt prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 54**] MICU.  A repeat ABG prior
   to her transfer was 7.18/73/237 on AC 400, 100%FI02, PEEP 8, RR 20.
   Also, per report pt had received around 5L IVF during her stay at the

   insufficiency (baseline creat 1.5), CHF, HTN, anemia, dementia,  and
   aortic stenosis and insufficiency who presents with hypotension.  She
   has had a poor PO intake and had not been doing well for the last
   several months. She was noted to be hiding her medications under her
   pillow, very constipated, refusing to eat or drink or get out of bed.
   Her daughter reports that worsening constipation and mental status over
   the last few days was what prompted the ED visit. Her daughter reports
   that recently the patient has needed to be spoon-fed medications.
   .
   She was transferred here from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**], where she was hypotensive
   with a BP of 68/48 right arm, 110/70 left, heart rate 79, respiratory
   rate 33 and temperature  of 94.2 rectally. At [**Location (un) 3**], she was noted to
   have a lactate of 6.4. A left femoral line was placed. She was given
   two liters of normal saline and started on dopamine, however she became
   tachycardic so was switched to levophed. She was given 1 gram of
   vancomycin and 1 gram of ceftriaxone.  She was given 300 mg aspirin for
   an elevated troponin of 0.806 (0.6 in 6/[**2110**]).
   Sepsis, Severe (with organ dysfunction)
   Assessment:
   BP has been mid 80s-low 100s on levo.  Pt has been agitated on and off
   through the day, moaning throwing her legs over the bed.  She is
   oriented to her first name, she does follow commands.  Her temp has
   ranged from 94.4 to 97.4 PO.   [**1-7**] blood clx from [**Location (un) 3**] came back
   with gram pos cocci in clusters.   LS clear, 02 SAT has been 100% on 3
   L NC.
   Action:
   She has received 3000cc of LR in boluses of a liter each, , IV cefepime
   and Azithromycin were added, she conts flagyl and vanco (as per level),
   levo conts at .3mcg/kg/min, she has not been started on vasopressin
   Response:
   Her ABG is worse 7.23/35/173 changed from 7.35/24/187 earlier today,
   her lactate has improved from 1.9 down from 2.8 and 5.1,her CKs are 295
   up from 210, MB 13 from 11, trop .47 down from .59, her creat has
   improved 2.3 down from a high of 3.0.  Her levophed has stayed at .3
   through the day
 unable to wean it.
   Plan:
   Cont to follow her labs, EKG, give IVF as needed, wean the levo when
   able, follow mental status, follow u/o, ABG
 unable to place an A line
   due to her constant moving and  the risk of her pulling the line out.
   Hypernatremia (high sodium)
   Assessment:
   Her Na remains high at 157 up from 153, poor u/o 10-30cc/hr which does
   not look concentrated, worsening pH 7.23 down from 7.35, creat has
   improved 2.3 from a high of 3.0.
   Action:
   Team to calculate her free water deficit
   Response:
   Her sodium remains high, poor u/o  despite IVF boluses, worsening pH
   Plan:
   Cont to follow labs, u/o, to start on D5W at 90cc/hr for 2 liters
   After discussion with the daughter with the resident, she is now a

   Assessment and Plan
   # Neutropenic fever/sepsis: Meets SIRS criteria witih tachycardia,
   fever, leukopenia and respiratory rate. Likely source is GI given loss
   of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and inability to tolerate PO.
   Patient was profoundly dehydrated with tachycardia, elevated lactate,
   all improved with aggressive hydration.  No fever since arrival to the
   floor.  Blood cultures sent, UA negative/ucx pending.  CXR without
   evidence of infiltrate and CT abd/pelvis pending, with prelim read
   negative for infection.  Patient does have
   - Follow up final read of CT for possible abd/pelvic source
   - Follow blood culture/urine culture.
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - Discuss with primary oncologist in am (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3782**]/covering fellow)
   - Continue to trend WBC, culture with spikes
   - Send stool cultures, cdiff
   - Continue IVF given fever and dehydration, see below
   - Vanc/cefepime/flagyl for broad coverage including GI
   source/anaerobes, can narrow based on cultures and clinical source
   .
   # Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Mostly resolved. Likely gastroenteritis,
   though given neutropenia, more concerning for occult cause.
   - NPO with ice chips for now
   - Advance to clears in am
   - Vanc/cefepime/flagyl as above
   - IVF overnight
   - Recheck lactate in am
   - Zofran prn nausea
   - Send stool cultures/c.diff
   .
   # Metastatic Stage IV breast Ca: Now 12 days post cycle two of
   adriamycin/cytoxan.  Continuing to get XRT to back and leg, last [**10-18**].
   - Will touch base with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3782**], primary onc in am.  Per OMR, appears
   next XRT is due in [**Month (only) **].
   .
   # Anxiety: Patient is quite tearful and anxious at this time.  Notes
   that she uses ativan at home for this prn.
   - Continue ativan prn
   - Consider SW consult in am
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now with ice chips, advance to clears in am, replete
   lytes prn, IVF overnight

   She underwent noninvasive imaging studies of her lower extremities,
   which demonstrated totally occluded bilateral superficial femoral
   arteries. She underwent left SFA stenting at [**Hospital1 19**] on [**2184-1-20**] and then
   presented to [**Hospital1 19**] on this day of admission for right SFA stenting.
   While in the cath lab, a catheter was introduced into the left femoral
   artery and wired through to the right SFA when a wire perforation
   occurred in the right SFA. She developed bleeding into the right thigh.
   She developed swelling in her right leg with thigh circumference of
   52cm compared to left thigh of 46 cm.

   HPI:
   53 year old man with h/o AML s/p allo cord transplant (now day +516)
   complicated by chronic GVHD with arthritis, BOOP, who presented to the
   BMT floor from clinic with worsening renal function(2.3), hyperkalemia,
   and worsening odynophagia. On arrival to the BMT floor, as he was
   transitioning into the bed, he became mom[**Name (NI) **] unresponsive to
   verbal stimuli and physical stimuli. No jerking movements or
   incontience were noted. A code blue was called. On arrival of the code
   team, BP 124/80, Hr 70s, satting 100% on 5L NC. He was responsive to
   verbal stimuli and answering questions appropriately. 1 amp of D50,
   10units regular insulin, and abuterol nebs were given for known
   hyperkalemia. An EKG was obtained which showed isolated peaked T waves.
   An ABG was sent off with normal lactate and K returning at 6.5. CXR
   showed no interval change when accounted for technique from prior in
   the day. One set of blood cultures and cardiac enzymes were obtained,
   and 1amp calcium gluconate was initiated for hyperkalemia. During this
   time, the patient reported intermittent pains in his forehead, jaw, and
   right thigh area. He had 2 more episodes where he closed his eyes and
   was not immediately arousable to verbal stimuli. He had one episode of
   shakes and given immunosuppression and concern for infection, he
   received 1gm cefepime.
   .
   On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], he reported chest discomfort and left arm
   numbness. EKG remained at baseline without St/T wave changes. His chest
   pain responded prior to administration of SL nitroglycerin.

   On review of systems, during the period on the BMT floor he denied
   visual changes, vertigo, abdominal pain, fevers, sweats. Over the past
   week, he has noted constipation, left elbow pain, pain with

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 40F with stage IIIB breast cancer with progression to
   brain mets who presented with dyspnea and a large pericardial effusion
   + tamponade physiology. She is now s/p pericardioscentesis with
   drainage of 500mL of a serosanguinous fluid and improvement of her
   symptoms. She remains persistently tachycardic.
   .
   #. Pericardial effusion: Given her history of advanced breast cancer
   this is likely a malignant effusion. Infection is a distant
   possibility. Signs of pericardial tamponade were seen on initial echo
   with improvement of hemodynamics and no residual effusion after tap. Of
   note, she has not been exposed to anthracyclines or recent XRT to the
   chest wall.
   - Continue to monitor vital signs
   - Follow output from pericardial drain
   - Repeat ECHO in the AM to evaluate for recurrence of effusion
   - Repeat CXR in the AM
   - Fluid chemistries consistent with a serosanguinous exudate
   - Fluid cytology pending. CBC of fluid has 60% ""other"" cells that are
   non-lymphoid and likely represent malignant clones. Cell count is
   [**Numeric Identifier 828**]/uL.
   - Fluid Gram stain negative for microorgs. Cultures pending
   - Consider pericardial window for recurrence of effusion
   .
   #. Pneumonia: Pt with recent diagnosis of PNA at OSH based on
   persistent low grade fevers, SOB, cough, and LUL infiltrate on CXR. On
   day [**3-26**] of treatment with azithromycin.
   - Complete azithromycin course
   - Repeat CXR as above
   - Blood cultures pending
   .
   #. Breast cancer: Stage IIIB, ER/PR/HER2 tripple negative with
   progression to metastatic disease. Of note, tumor was large and
   approached the chest wall. She was treated with neoadjuvant
   cyclophosphamide and taxotere, surgery, and XRT to the chest wall. She
   subsequently developed brain mets without evidence of leptomeningeal
   carcinomatosis. She is s/p recent brain XRT and steroids for edema.
   - Update med onc that patient is in house in the AM. Input appreciated.
   - Continue symptomatic control of pain, nausea as needed
   - No acute intervention at this time
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Likely compensatory from tamponade physiology, toxic
   metabolic state, and volume depletion from recent poor PO intake.
   - Low Na on admission consistent with hypovolemia.
   - Replete fluids PRN. Received 4L prior to transfer to the CCU.
   - Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism given this is a
   hypercoaguable patient. Since she is not a candidate for systemic
   anticoagulation in the context of potentially hemorrhagic brain mets
   and bloody pericardial effusion, we will hold off on further workup for
   now.
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: Given clinicl picture of poor PO intake for several
   days, persistent tachycardia, and hyponatremia this is most likely
   consistent with hypovolemia. DD includes siADH from a CNS or lung
   process.
   - Replete fluids as above
   - Ulytes pre-renal
   - Hyponatremia improved with IVF
   .
   #. FEN: Normal diet. Replete electrolytes PRN
   .
   #. Access:  PIV
   .
   #. PPx: Heparin SQ, no need for GI PPx for now
   .
   #. Code:  FULL

   #. Dispo:  CCU for now pending above

   grade fevers at home
   HPI:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5574**] is an 84 yo man with a high-grade cardiac B-cell
   lymphoma for which he is now undergoing R-[**Hospital1 988**] chemotherapy and a
   history of COPD, DVT s/p IVC filter, and pneumonia with
   respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation in [**2-27**]. Today is
   Day 15 of Cycle 4 or R-[**Hospital1 988**], which he received during his hospital
   admission from [**Date range (1) 6761**]. He received Neulasta on [**4-10**].  following
   his discharge, he has been feeling generally well; however, he admits
   to increasing exertional dyspnea overthe past 2-3 days. He explains
   that very light activity, such as changing his clothes or walking short
   distances, has resulted in significant shortness of breath. He denies
   cough, sputum production, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and
   swelling/pain of the arms or legs. He admits to low-grade fevers today;
   while visiting, his daughter noted that he had a temperature of 100.4
   degrees. For this reason, he was advised to report to the Emergency
   Room for evaluation.
   Upon arrival in the Emergency Department, had temperature of 99.6
   degrees. He was tachycardic to 118 and tachypneic (RR 30-40) with
   oxygen saturations of 95% on room air. During the first several
   minutesof is Emergency Department course, he developed rapidly
   increasing work of breathing. A CXR demonstrated no evidence
   ofpneumonia or effusion; furthermore, an echocardiogram showed no
   pericardial effusion. He was noted to have a WBC of 8.8 with 26%
   neutrophils and 36% bands. Due to progressive respiratorydistress
   without hypoxia, he was started on BiPAP. In addition, he was given IV
   solumderol 125mg, ASA 325mg, bronchodilators, piperacillin-tazobactam,
   and vancomycin. Also received total of 1.25mg of ativan in ED.
   Despite a fairly normal blood gas and presumbaly secondary to worsening
   dyspnea and tachynpnea, pt was started on BIPAP which he tolerated
   during his transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  On arrival, he insisted that it be
   removed and then resumed.  He was agitated and extremely anxious
   repeating ""I need air,"" peripheral sats were in the 93-100% range on
   room air.  Seemed to be more comfortable leaning forward and placing
   his weight on his upper ext's. His HR rose in propotion to his
   tachypnea and gitation to a rate of 140's transiently. Agitation/anxiey
   waxed and waned with pt sleeping intermittently.
   ONCOLOGIC HISTORY (Per recent note by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4299**]:  [**Known firstname **]
   [**Known lastname 5574**] initially presented on [**2198-12-30**], with anewly identified 8
   cm right atrial soft tissue mass.  He underwent biopsy of this on
   [**2200-1-3**], and pathology showed high-grade aggressive diffuse large
   B-cell lymphoma, staining positive for CD20, bcl-2, and bcl-6 in a
   small subset. Cells were negative for cytokeratins, CD138, bcl-1, and
   bcl-6. MIB fraction was 95-100%.  Bcl-2 co-expression and lack of CD10
   argued against Burkitt's  lymphoma; however, FISH studies were positive
   for c-myc rearrangement.  He was diagnosed with high-grade cardiac
   lymphoma on the spectrum of diffuse large B-cell to Burkitt's
   lymphoma.  No other sites of disease were identified by torso CT and
   bone marrow biopsy.  He has begun R-[**Hospital1 988**]  chemotherapy on [**2200-1-7**].
   Treatment course has been complicated by a DVT status post IVC filter
   in [**1-/2200**] and pneumonia requiring intubation for hypoxia in [**2-27**].

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   84 year-old M with high-grade cardiac lymphoma (left atrial mass),
   currently receiving treatment (cycle 4,day 15) with R-[**Hospital1 988**] presents
   from home with low-grade fevers and progressive dyspnea;  despite
   marked tachypnea and dyspnea, pt's images and blood gas look
   remarkably good suggesting a strong contribution from anxiety.  That
   said, he has an atypical WBC diff and is s/p recent chemotherapy and
   thus in a relatively immunocompromised state demanding empiric broad
   coverage with Abx.  Physical Exam is most suggestive of COPD
   exacerbation, but dyspnea is out of proportion to boreline (if any)
   hypoxia.
   # Dyspnea / Tachypnea:  From what can be gathered of his ED course, it
   seems that it was similar to how he has been in the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]. Dyspnea is
   out of proportion to hypoxia.  Have been thus far unable to repeat
   blood gas secondary to agitation, but peripheral sats in mid to high
   90s even on room air.  When he has used Bipap, settings hve been 17/5
   on room air--he intermittently prefers this to face mask.  Bedside echo
   in the ED notable for absence of effusion/tamponade. LV function
   grossly intact. CXR without pulmonary edema. CTA ruled out PE and
   showed ONLY Opacity in RLL which may represent early bacterial PNA vs
   aspiration. Pt does have Hx of DVT, but IVC filter is in place and no
   exam finding to suggest current DVT.  Overall, it seems that anxiety
   may be contributing strongly to this presentation--although does not
   seem to be on home anxiolytics other than low dose ativan for nausea.
   His positional preference and prolonged expiratory phase are suggestive
   of COPD exacerbation (FVC 50%, FEV1 40%  Predicted), but again dyspnea
   out of proportion to hypoxia.  Caridiac ischemia also a possibility as
   pt has reported hx of a silent inferior MI in [**2198**], curently not on
   ASA, BB, statin.
   - add BNP to admission labs; may be elevated in setting of atrial mass,
   but if negative still useful to r/o failure
   - repeat CXR this am
   - formal ECHO by tech ordered
   - repeat blood gas when tolerats
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   - albuterol/ipratropium nebs (holding home spiriva); continuing advair;
   will d/w BMT regarding +/- of systemic steroids in this lymphoma pt
   undergoing tx
   - NIPPV on RA vs 2L face-mask per pt preference; O2 sats adeqquate on
   either
   # Low-Grade Fevers / Bandemia: Bandemia present on [**4-17**], but not to
   the prounced degree that it is now.  Pt's fevers at home were
   low-grade, was afebrile in ED and on floor.  There is a concern for
   relative immunocompromise as he is currently receiving tx for lymphoma.
   Pt is s/p PNA requiring intubation during a recent hospitalization.
   Some concern for infectious process on admission CTA, but RLL findings
   not particulary striking. UA clean.
   - Blood cultures x2 pending, Urine Cx pending, Sputum ordered. Repaet
   Cx if spikes.
   - Nasal aspirate for respiratory viruses: (influenza,paraninfluenza,
   RSV)
   - D/w BMT whether atypical Diff is expected with pt's recent treatemnts
   or whether it is more concerning for infxn. Smear ordered.
   - Empiric therapy for HAP Vanco/Zosyn per BMT
   # Cardiac lymphoma: The patient appears to have had an excellent
   response to therapy to date, with a decline in his LDH and shrinkage of
   his cardiac mass on cardiac MRI. He will be due for his 5th cycle of
   [**Hospital1 988**] next week, and his ability to receive his chemotherapy safelywill
   be determined by his recover from his present illness.
   - d/w BMT
   # Hx of CAD: Alleged silent MI in [**2198**]. Not in our records and pt
   currently unbale to discuss. EKG suggestive of prior infarct, but ECHO
   is not. Unusual that he is not on home ASA, BB, or statin.
   - will d/w pt and BMT
   # Hx of DVT: Per previous DC summary, pt has had a recent DVT in
   setting of ongoing malignancy and has IVC filter in place--by report
   has contraindication to systemic anticoagulation.

   ADDENDUM TO PLAN:
   Assessment and plan initially changed this am as cardiac enzymes
   positive and ECHO showing significant new focal wall motion
   abnormaiilities.  These findings are c/w either ACS (plaque rupture) vs
   very significant demand ischemia secondary to a poorly defined acute
   stressor (see above differential).  Pt now on ASA, BB (with goal
   HR~60), Statin (declined lipitor given hx of muscle pains, given
   simvastatin 80). Heparin drip started w/o bolus. Per BMT, seems that
   only contraindication to anticoag (unclear this am) has been concern
   that this right atrial mass would bleed into pericardial space.  Still
   believe that pt
s resp status compromised by COPD given exam, but heart
   failure secondary to active ischemia likely also contributing.
   -- cardiology consulted, f/u recommendations
   -- remainder of plan largely as outlined above: treat COPD, cont broad

   heart block, bradycardia, hypotension
   HPI:
   Please see admission H&P for details prior to hospital presentation.
   Briefly, 75 year-old female with reported history of CAD although
   recent ([**3-20**]) cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries, severe
   recurrent mitral stenosis of porcine valve ([**2171**]), moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension with RVH, sarcoidosis, awaiting mitral and
   aortic valve replacements transferred to CCU for bradycardia,
   hypotension and found to have complete heart block. Patient was
   admitted [**2177-4-13**] in anticipation of valve surgery; she was transferred
   to cardiology service due to worsened dyspnea and respiratory acidosis,
   thought to be secondart to decompensated heart failure and pneumonia.
   She completed a 10 day course of ceftriaxone. She was aggressively
   diuresed. She improved, and this morning was stable on 4L nasal
   cannula. Per review of records, she was complaining of increased
   dyspnea this morning. She was started on a Lasix drip, diltiazem dose
   was decreased (180>120mg PO daily), and carvedilol started (3.125mg PO
   BID).
   At 4:00PM on afternoon of admission, she was complaining of nausea and
   lightheadedness and was found to have a systolic BP 64, heart rate 50s.
   She was given a 500cc bolus and sBP increased to 93. A 12-lead EKG was
   obtained, and patient was found to be in complete heart block with a
   rate in the 50s. Pacer pads were placed (pacing was not required), and
   dopamine started. Patient was subsequently transfered to the CCU.
   On arrival to the CCU, patient appeared to be in heart block. She was
   nauseous, and with emesis was found to have heart rate increased to 70s
   (sinus rhythm). This again transitioned back to heart block, and
   patient complained of nausea without relief with Zofran or compazine.
   She was administered glucagon (3mg IV x1), and subsequently converted
   back to sinus rhythm. Pacing was not required. She subsequently had
   relief of her nausea.

   2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and left sided filling
   pressures with RVEDP of 5 mmHg and LVEDP of 8 mmHg. There was severe
   pulmonary hypertension with a PAP of 75/27 mmHg. The mean PCWP was
   moderately elevated at 26 mmHg. There was normal cardiac index of 2.4
   L/min/m2. There was no significant aortic valve gradient. There was
   severe mitral stenosis with a mean mitral gradient of 19 mmHg and valve
   area of 0.69 cm2.

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with reported history of CAD although recent ([**3-20**]) cardiac
   catheterization with clean coronaries, severe recurrent mitral stenosis
   of porcine valve ([**2171**]), moderate PAH with RVH, sarcoidosis, recently
   admitted to cardiology service with decompensated heart failure,
   pneumonia admitted to CCU with bradycardia, hypotension and found to
   have complete heart block. Currently sinus rhythm
   #. Rhythm:  Patient has known paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. At onset
   of hypotension, nausea this morning patient was noted to be in complete
   heart block with rate in 50s. The differential for this in this patient
   includes medications (on diltiazem, amiodarone at home; low-dose
   nonselective beta-blocker added this morning), sarcoidosis. ischemic
   heart disease, idiopathic progressive cardiac conduction disease. Given
   medication changes this morning, most likely etiology is medications.
   - Hold all nodal blocking agents at this time, including amiodarone,
   diltiazem, and carvedilol
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Pacer pads at bedside
   - Holding heparin gtt at this time; will likely restart in the morning
   - this is important given that PAF in combination with mitral stenosis
   puts the patient at high risk for developing clot
   - Continue aspirin
   #. Pump:  Several recent admissions for decompensated heart failure.
   Likely etiology stems from severe mitral stenosis, with resultant
   pulmonary artery hypertension and right heart failure. Avoids mildly
   fluid overloaded at this time with trace lower extremity edema and
   positive hepatojugular reflex.
   - Holding Lasix at this time give lower blood pressure this morning
   - Will attempt to wean off of dobutamine
   #. Coronaries:  No evidence of CAD on recent cardiac catheterization.
   #. Mitral valve stenosis:  Patient was scheduled for repair of this
   valve earlier this month but delayed due to decompensated heart
   failure. Currently MV area 0.69cm2 with transmitral gradient 19.
   Patient also with history of aortic stenosis based on records, although
   this same cardiac catherization showed an aortic valve area of 3.74cm2
   with transaortic gradient 7. Given that mitral valve is porcine,
   anticoagulation is not needed; nonetheless, given MV stenosis and PAF,
   patient is at high risk for clot formation.
   #. Anemia:  Hematocrit 25.4; well within patient's baseline. Studies
   from [**2177-4-17**] show iron-deficiency anemia with iron 21. B12, folate not
   checked in our system although patient takes B12 as an outpatient.
   - Continue vitamin B12 supplementation
   - Continue iron supplementation
   #. Sarcoidosis:  No pathology in our records.
   #. COPD:  PFTs from [**2177-3-21**] show FVC 56%, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC 90% with
   moderate expiratory coving with moderately reduced volume excursio -
   moderate obstructive diseae. Patient with poor airmovement on exam
   currently.
   - Continue Advair, ipratropium and albuterol nebs
   # FEN:  Cardiac, heart healthy diet; replete lytes as needed
   # Access:  PIV (2)

   large A-a gradient, and low PaO2/FiO2 are consistent with ARDS/acute
   lung injury.  MRSA on sputum sample from OSH suggestive of
   superinfection following a viral pneumonia but influenza/viral screen
   was negative. Desats to low 80
s with activity, patient is gagging with
   ETT and biting the tube
   Action:
   She will need continued management of ARDS with ventilatory support.
   Currently with high FiO2, high PEEP.
   Continue vanc/zosyn, continue solumedrol
   Droplet precaution to rule out influenza
   Sedation changed to versed , fentanyl, sputum culture from ETT.
   Response:
   Blood gas this AM 7.45/43/61/4/31,
   Plan:
   Bronch in a.m. to rule out atypical causes of pneumonia given recent
   steroid use
    ARDS management with target tidal volumes of 5 cc/hr, permissive
   hypercapnia
   Wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   Consider esophogeal balloon to optimize PEEP settings
   Continue antibiotics, F/U culture results

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   94F with CAD, history of CVA, prior hip fracture; presenting s/p fall
   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # Hip fracture.  History of ORIF of same leg with new comminuted
   fracture of distal femur.  Ortho has seen; possible OR for repair.
   Preoperative risk assessment - patient is currently high risk for
   surgery with at least one major predictor of intraoperative cardiac
   morbidity with evidence of elevated troponins/active myocardial
   ischemia (though this likely is reflective of increased demand).
   However, she has a significant femoral fracture necessitating operative
   repair if in line with goals of care.
   - Ortho is on board and have attempted contact with the daughter who is
   the health care proxy. We should touch base with Ortho and also try to
   contact the daughter and find out if she wants to proceed with surgery
   or not.
   - Troponins continue to trend overall downwards and will stop trending
   them
   - Consider cards consult for input re: operative risk if she is heading
   towards the OR.
   - DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - Will stop trending Troponins
   - EKG and cardiac enzymes if she develops chest pain or any change in
   clinical status
   - ASA, high dose statin
   - Continue beta blocker in perioperative setting.
   - Was not started on Plavix or Heparin gtt and will not start her on
   either now that Trop
s are decreasing
   - Will get echo today
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.
   - Cspine collar for now.
   - Trauma has recommended that we try to clear the C-spine clinically.
   Will f/u with them to see exactly what this means.
   - Has many plain films of the neck and R arm and other CT scans to
   assess for fractures, these will need to be followed up on
   - Unsure the etiology of her fall and unable to fully elucidate by
   history, so would keep her on telemetry to evaluate for dysrhythmia,
   will get echo today, consider carotid U/S, and if any evidence of
   seizure activity get Neuro involved and get EEG monitoring.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis.  History of chronic urinary frequency at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on
   methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**1-13**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Leukocytosis.  Neutrophil predominance without bands.  [**Month (only) 51**] in part be
   related to stress of new fracture; also consider UTI or other infection
   or MI related. Continues to rise but has been afebrile.
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Send blood cultures if spikes.
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Hypotensive episode.  Per report at OSH.  Further details and
   etiology unclear.  Very transient - unlikely to be shock from sepsis.
   Had also considered PE, transient myocardial ischemia, or vagal
   episode, but these seemed less likely. Currently her BP
s have been
   good and she is actually trending towards HTN rather than hypoTN.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Trops have been declining so will stop monitoring
   - Continue Metoprolol for now but with close monitoring of BP and would
   stop immediately if having hypotension.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented and described as ""cranky"".  Here
   patient is somewhat lethargic with speech that seems sometimes confused
   and at other times is difficult to understand.  Likely delerium in
   setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue home meds with holding parameters.
   - Give IV metoprolol if not taking PO meds.
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine once taking PO.
   # Depression
   - continue bupropion.
   # Glaucoma.
   - continue home meds.

   He was admitted to the ICU for post-operative monitoring given his
   baseline pulmonary function which is somewhat impaired [**2-28**] bleo
   toxicity. He was seen in clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3-2**] for pulmonary
   clearance for surgery and had been complaining of URI symptoms. Sr.
   [**Doctor Last Name 13138**] assessment was that he has some emphysema and some belomycin
   lung toxicity that have resulted in only mildly abnormal lung function.
   He was treated with azithromycin and advair. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended
   for continuation of Advair after surgery.

    In comparison with the study of [**2107-10-6**], the nodular opacifications
   in both lung zones have decreased in size and density. This could
   reflect
   successful chemotherapy. There is again dense calcification of lymph

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo male with history of CAD, A fib, dCHF (EF 55%), PAD
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Unclear etiology.  No evidence of infection,
   with out pneumonia on CXR, no fevers/chills, negative UA.  Drugs may
   play a role: levaquin is notorious, he also takes oxycodone, so
   influence of narcotics also may be at play.  Patient has mild ARF (up
   to 2.2, resolved by day after admission), so may also be a component
   (increasing toxicity of neurontin). Patient is reaching for objects
   that are not there and he may be having myoclonic jerks. history of
   fall, so will hold on NCHCT.
   - hold levofloxacin
   - hold narcotics if possible
   - IVF
   - f/u blood and urine culture
   .
   #. Hypoxia:  Unclear etiology.  Likely chronic, given elevated HCO3. No
   clinical evidence of pneumonia.  CXR w/o consolidation, no symptoms of
   cough or fevers, and no leukocytosis; but is also vaguely suggestive of
   a primary pleural process (pleural plaques), possibly mesothelioma.
   Patient does have a history of dCHF, but no pulmonary edema on CXR,
   flat JVP, and dry MM.  PE unlikely in the absence of tachycardia, EKG
   changes.
   - ABG for AA gradient
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - consider chest CT to better characterize
   .
   #. Transient Hypotension: Resolved. The patient had one episode of
   hypotension in the ED with systolic pressures of 80. The patient
   received only 2L NS with resolution of the hypotension. Given his mild
   acute renal failure, likely this is related to hypovolemia. Dry mucous
   membranes on exam.  No clinical evidence of pneumonia by symptoms, CXR,
   or [**Last Name (LF) 14444**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] low suspicion of septic etiology
   - Monitor BP closely, goal MAP > 60
   - Volume resuscitation PRN with IV NS boluses
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Likely prerenal given volume
   depletion and hypotension.  Will check urine lytes if does not improve
   w/ IVF.
   - Volume resuscitation
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   #. PAD: Recent stent placement to SFA on right to treat non-healing
   ulcer. Still with slowly healing ulcer, and recent follow up w/
   vascular surgery.
   - wound c/s in AM
   - cont ASA/plavix
   - pt w/ lipitor allergy.
   #. CAD: No acute process, trop mildly elevated likely secondary to
   acute on chronic renal failure. Will continue aspirin and plavix as
   above. The patient has a history of bradycardia, which is likely why he
   is not maintained on a beta blocker.  No ACS on EKG.
   #. Diastolic CHF: Preserved EF on recent echo in [**11-26**]. It appears the
   patient's ACE-I has been held since [**Month (only) **] because of falls and low
   blood pressures. Will hold lasix in the setting of acute renal failure.
   Monitor for signs of volume overload.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently in sinus rhythm. Not on rate control
   secondary to bradycardia, not on coumadin secondary to falls.
   #. History of prostate cancer/bladder cancer/uretheral stricture.
   Patient w/ indwelling foley.
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue gabapentin. hold oxycodone.
   #. Depression: Continue citalopram
   FEN: NPO until speech and swallow, replete PRN

   HPI:
   History is taken per the patient who is a very poor historian.  He
   reports that over the past two days he has been confused and has had
   trouble thinking and speaking.  He cannot explain further. He is not
   experiencing any pain.  No fevers or chills.  No chest pain or
   difficulty breathing.  No nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
   constipation, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or swelling.  No focal
   numbness or weakness.  No blurry vision or diplopia.  No lightheadeness
   or dizziness  No gait instability.  No headache, photophobia or neck
   stiffness.  He cannot explain the sensation further.  He presented to
   [**Hospital3 **] hospital.
   He initially presented to Cape Code hospital were his vital signs were
   T: 97.7 BP: 97/62 HR: 92 RR: 16 O2: 100% on RA. Labs were notable for a
   troponin of 0.01, BNP of 12.5, Tbili of 0.6, Na 133, K 4.0, Cl 97, Co2
   27, BUN 10, Cr 0.98, Glu 100, INR 1.1, WBC 12.1, Hct 25, Plts 406.  He
   had a CT of the head which showed a low attenuation zone in the
   posterior corona radiate left extending along the left external capsule
   of uncertain etiology.  MRI scan showed multiple acute/subacute
   infracts with paramagnetic effect left temporal lobe and right parietal
   hemisphere suggestive of hemosiderin from hemorrhage. He was
   transferred to this hospital for further management.
   In the ED, initial vs were: T: 98.8 P: 80 BP: 82/56 R: 20 O2 sat 98% on
   RA. His initial EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 83, leftward axis,
   incomplete right bundle branch, TWI in V1, V2, no acute ST segment
   changes, no priors for comparison.  Patient was given three liters of
   normal saline, vancomycin 1 gram IV x 1, zosyn 4.5 g IV x 1.  He
   develped a mild erythematous rash after receiving vancomycin and
   received benadryl 50 mg IV x 1.
   On arrival to the floor he has no specific complaints but says he feels
   funny.  He is able to name common objects but is unable to say why he
   is in the hospital.  He gets very agitated during interview.  Unable to
   obtain further history.

   WBC 12.1, Hct 25, Plts 406.
   Imaging: MRI/MRA Head w/o contrast [**2164-9-25**]: Multiple acute/subacute
   infracts with paramagnetic effect left temporal lobe and rigth parietal
   hemisphere suggestive of hemosiderin from hemorrhage.  Suggestion of
   petechail hemorrhage was also noted on recent head CT.  The
   multiplicity of infarcts is suggestive of embolic source. There is
   gradual narrowing of the M2 segment of the left middle cerebral artery
   with paucity of signal involving cistal branch vessels.  Findings are
   consistent with hemodynamically significant stenosis and probable
   distal occlusion  There is no evidence of aneurysm or high flow AVM.
   Microbiology: blood and urine cultures pending
   ECG: normal sinus rhythm at 83, leftward axis, incomplete right bundle
   branch, TWI in V1, V2, no acute ST segment changes, no priors for
   comparison.
   Assessment and Plan
 CVA (STROKE, CEREBRAL INFARCTIO
   Assessment and Plan: 39 year old male with a history of mitral valve
   endocarditis and IV drug use presenting with word finding difficulties
   and new infarctions on brain MRI.
   Word finding difficulties/Brain lesions:  Difficult for me to ilicit on
   exam tonight as patient is non-cooperative but was described at [**Location (un) **] as an expressive aphasia.  He reports a remote history of
   endocarditis and IV drug use although exam is notable for an apical
   murmur and his toxicology screen is positive for cocaine and
   barbituates. Concern that this may represent endocarditis with septic
   embolic phenomenon. Cardiology is aware of case with plans for TEE in
   AM.  Neurology is also consult and will see the patient in the ICU.
   - NPO for TEE in AM
   - cardiology consult
   - neurology consult
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - will cover with vancomycin and ceftriaxone empirically for
   endocarditis pending blood cultures and TEE (will need to monitor
   closely given concern for rash in ER)
   - will need to obtain outside medical records
   - consider ID consult
   - HIV test in AM
   Hypotension:  Patient with blood pressures in the 80s to 90s systolic.
   Asymptomatic.  Not tachycardia.  Afebrile with normal WBC count.  Mild
   anemia.  Blood pressures improved with IVF.  Concern that this may be
   related to endocarditis/mitral valve disease.
   - monitor blood pressures
   - TEE
   - guaiac stools, assess for blood loss
   - blood cultures, urine cultures and antibiotics as above for potential
   endocarditis
   - will check cardiac enzymes given positive cocaine history
   Anemia:  Unclear etiology.  Patient with mildly low blood pressures
   which could be related to blood loss.
   - guaiac stools
   - iron studies
   - trend hematocrit

   Assessment and Plan
   ##. PNA: One review of prior films PNA appears to have progressed.
   During his hospitalization he was treated with IV Vanc and Cefepime and
   discharged on a course of Augementin x 10 days. Will continue on
   Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin for CAP, Vancomycin for HAP given recent
   hospitalizations.
   .
   ##. Altered Mental Status: Ddx include Status Epilepticus, delirium,
   meningitis, intracranial disease. On review of pt's mentation prior to
   his AMA discharge acute delirium from his underlying PNA is high on the
   differential, and was likely only partially treated. His waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 42**] non-verbal status speaks for this. However his presentation this
   AM is quite different and there is concern for central sources
   including seizure and intracranial disease.  We must r/o viral
   meningitises/encephalitises.  Will f/u on LP labs, HSV PCR. Pt was
   noted to have auditory hallucinations which is interesting given the
   ?mass in his temporal lobe. Neurology were consulted in the ED and
   recommended infectious work up, MRI/MRA, U/A, avoid psychotrophics.
   Something clearly driving hyperventilation, as patient is alkalemic on
   ABG with relative respiratory alkalosis.
   - EEG ASAP while still altered
   - will check MRI/MRA brain w/ and w/o contrast
   - will check U/A, LFTs
   - will avoid psychotropics, consider seroquel
   - f/u LP, add on HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV
   - TSH, B12, RPR, Folate
   - given LP is negative will d/c Ceftriaxone
   - treat underlying PNA
 Vanc, Cefepime given acute illness, frequent
   hospitalizations.
   - frequent ABG
s, prepare for possible intubation.
   .
   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis
   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue
   on outpatient Prednisone dose.
   - confirm various ppx meds
   .
   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline
   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation. Will
   start on Labetalol.
   - labetalol 10mg q6h for now
   - ?autonomic dysregulation versus infection
   .
   ##. FEN: NPO for now, S&S when mentation improves.
   .
   ##. CODE STATUS: Confirmed full
   .
   ##. DISPOSITION: Pending Mental Status improvement.

   HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 4680**] is a 69-year-old male with past medical history
   significant for severe COPD on home oxygen at 4L, HTN, GERD, CAD (prior
   NSTEMI), hyperlipidemia, h/o resistant pseudomonas PNA and chronic back
   pain who was brought to ED via EMS after wife noticed he had worse
   confusion and altered mentation this evening. Patient denies recent
   cough, fevers, chills or increased/discolored sputum production. There
   was initial concern for COPD flare up from possible infection as well
   but CXR was unremarkable for PNA and he remained hemodynamically stable
   with no fevers.  Much of history collected from wife given patient's
   AMS.
   .
   In ED , a fentanyl patch was noticed on his back and he was having some
   slurred speech so there was concern for narcotic induced hypercarbia
   after initial ABG showed pH 7.28, pCO2 116, pO2 56, HCO3 57. He is also
   taking Ativan and Percocet at home regularly for anxiety and low back
   pain. He also complained of some generalized weakness along with 1 week
   of more focal right hand weakness. Therefore, neurology was called to
   evaluate him in ED and his exam was non-focal. A CT head was done which
   was unremarkable.   Neurology recommended additional  head and neck CTA
   to evaluate vessels more closely.
   .
   Initial vitals in ED were: T98.2F, HR 93, BP 137/77, RR 28 and O2
   Saturation 99% on 6L. He was given albuterol nebs, ipratropium nebs,
   125mg IV Solumedrol, 1g IV Ceftriaxone, 500mg IV Azithromycin and
   Naloxone .4mg x1 for presumed narcotic induced respiratory distress. He
   became quite agitated after Naloxone so he was given 2.5mg IV Haldol.
   Lactate was normal at 0.8 and he also had hyperkalemia to 5.4 range.
   WBC count was normal at 8.6 and Hct near baseline at 37.2. FSG was
   184.  Repeat ABG much improved s/p BIPAP with pH 7.36, pCO2
   85, pO2 65, HCO3 50.
   .
   On evaluation in the MICU, he appeared cachectic and frail and was
   confused and  agitated. He was not cooperative with initial questions
   but then calmed down within minutes and was able to give a limited
   history. Speech somewhat garbled at baseline and patient was only
   oriented to place and year but did not know month or why exactly he was
   in ICU.
   REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per HPI. Limited ROS otherwise due to patient's
   AMS. Patient also endorses decreased appetite and wife also
   corroborates poor PO intake x 1 week.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4680**] is a 69-year-old male with severe COPD on home 4L NC, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia, CAD (s/p , GERD, depression and chronic back pain on
   multiple sedating pain medications and psychiatric medications who
   presented with AMS, hypercarbic respiratory distress.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory distress: Most likely etiology is narcotic and
   BZD induced respiratory depression atop of his usual COPD retainer
   status at baseline. Patient is taking fentanyl patch, Percocet & Ativan
   at home.  Unlikely an underlying infection with  COPD exacerbation
   given his normal WBC count, lack of fevers, and normal CXR. Also
   unclear if he is compliant with his home oxygen.
   .
   -plan to continue on NC overnight with goal O2 sats between 88-92% - do
   not hyperoxygenate
   -place back on BIPAP if desaturates (none needed overnight)
   -recheck ABG on current NC
   -f/up final CXR read
   -f/up blood cultures
   -continue on albuterol, ipratropium nebs q4hrs PRN
   -continue daily Advair
   -will hold off on additional antibiotics at this time ( aside from his
   PPx Bactrim)
   - FYI pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2045**]
   .
   #agitation/confusion: Likely secondary to hypercarbia and narcotics as
   outlined above. Half life of recently removed fentanyl patches ( 2)
   still lingering x 24 hours. CT head r/o any acute process.
   -continue to monitor O2 sats, ABGs
   -PRN Haldol if becomes belligerent
   .
   #Right sided weakness: Subtle weakness with right sided hand grasp,
   other CNs [**2-17**] all normal on exam. Neurology service saw patient in ED
   and felt no acute exam focal findings, CT head negative. Recommended a
   f/up CTA which was ordered in ED. Recent slurred speech resolved now
   and was most likely secondary to his narcotics.
   -f/up final read of CT
   -f/up formal neurology notes
   -repeat neuro exam in morning
   .
   #Coronary Artery Disease: Past medical history significant for prior
   NSTEMI in [**2101**]. He has no c/o current chest pain or palpitations.
   -continue on telemetry
   -continue usual home daily ASA 81mg
   -continue daily pravastatin
   #. Hypertension: Currently normotensive and stable. BPs in
   120-130s/60-70s range.
   - continue on home Lisinopril 5 mg daily
   .
   #Depression: Mood stable. Denies any suicidal ideation.
   - continue Sertraline 50 mg
   - hold Ativan for now given recent over-sedation
   - SW consult
   .
   #. Chronic Back Pain:  Given concern for decreased respirations and
   somnolence with hypercarbia will hold sedating narcotics for now.
   -holding fentanyl patch and percocet
   -Tylenol PRN for pain control
   -consider lidocaine patch instead of fentanyl patch vs. lower dose
   oxycodone on a more spaced dosing routine
   -palliative care has met w patient and family in past. Reconsult to
   involve in patient
   .
   #. GERD: Denies active reflux symptoms, stable without complaints.
   -continue on home Protonix 40mg PO daily
   .
   #BPH: urine output currently within normal limits, will plan to
   continue usual home Finasteride 5mg PO daily
   .
   #FEN: NPO overnight, if MS improves, can advance diet
   #Access: got 20g and 22g
   #PPX: continue usual home PPI as above, bowel regimen with Senna,
   Colace, Miralax and Lactulose home regimen
   #Dispo: ICU for BIPAP, if stable and improves possible call out

   Assessment and Plan
   22 yo female with history of asthma admitted with clear clinical
   history for pneumonia and with right sided lobar infiltrate.  She has
   significant hypoxemia and following admission patient had evolution of
   worsening hypoxema and by exam and CXR has both worsening infiltrate
   and likley effusion driving changes on CXR.
   1)       PNEUMONIA-Multilobar pneumonia at admission.  She has physical
   exam findings consistent with collapse with egophany and bronchial
   breath sounds.  CXR would suggest some component of effusion and will
   have to consider tap of fluid.
   -Vanco/Levo
   -Sputum GS C+S and follow up blood cultures
   -Will have IP evaluation pleural space for possible tap but by exam
   would suspect that volume of fluid may be too small to be amenable to
   tap
   -Will check viral pathogens for completeness but seems less likely.
   -Will verify UCG negative
if positive could certainly consider
   influenza
   -Will maintain in ICU given concern for significant evolution of
   multi-lobal pneumonia
   2)Asthma-_No evidence of bronchospasm on exam or in recent history
   -Continue with inhaled steroids

   the pt is a 71yob woman with a h/o paranoid dementia who was recently d/c'd from the hospital ([**1-4**]) with plans to f/u with an outpt neuropsych consult. she lives alone and called ems on [**1-13**] c/o ""something choking her."" once she arrived in the ew, she refused all treatment, claiming that the staff was attempting to poison her. psych consulted and was in the process of planning an inpt psych admission via the ew when the pt passed a melenic stool and became hypotensive (sbp ~100) and tachycardic. her hct fell from 37 to 31. the pt received 2 liters of ns and 1u prbc's in the ew. she refused an ngt for lavage. gi was consulted and subsequently planned an elective intubation in order to perform an egd. she was transferred to the micu last evening but the egd was put on hold until this morning. serial hcts overnoc, however, have been stable. she is also hemodynamically stable and has not passed any melena since the single episode in the ew.

review of systems

respiratory-> lung exam is cta. she is maintaining sats >97% on room air and denies sob.

cardiac-> hr 90-100's, sr/st w/frequent pac's. t waves are elevated and the micu resident is aware. she was aggressively repleted with kcl, kphos, and magso4 overnoc. repeat lytes are still pnding. sbp ranging 110-140's.

neuro-> pt has slept for most of the shift but is easily aroused. she is oriented to self only and is intermittently restless when awake. she is mae, ue>le. she is unable to consistently follow commands or answer questions.

gi-> abd is soft, nontender w/+bs. -bm overnoc. serial hcts 34->33 checked approx q4hrs. inr is within normal range as well. ?need to proceed w/egd this morning. although receiving maintainence fluids, the pt is c/o thirst and wants something to eat and drink.

gu-> foley is patent and intact. uop >50cc/hr. she is approx 1 liter tfb positive for her los.

acess-> #18g angio in the right arm as well as a double lumen right femerol central line.

social-> pt lives alone but has a daughter and grandson. per admission notes, the family has been inquiring into long term care since they feel that they can no longer care for the pt at home. the pt is unkept and reportedly noncomplient w/taking her meds. she will need a social service consult asap this admission.

dispo-> ?transfer to medicine later today. the transfer note has been written.

   HPI:
   History of Present Illness:  This is a 68 year old gentleman with h/o
   CAD, DM2, HTN, hep C who presents with 4 days of productive cough and
   shortness of breath.  He reports that beginning 4 days ago, he
   developed cough productive of yellow/brown sputum which has worsened
   over this time period.  He notes shortness of breath worsening in this
   setting.  He endorses chills, but denies subjective fevers.  He also
   reports anterior chest pain with coughing and worse with deep
   inspiration.
   .
   In addition, over the past several days he has had profuse watery
   diarrhea which has slowed yesterday and no episodes today.  He reports
   he noted ""specks of blood"" in his stool when the diarrhea was heavy.
   He reports stool was dark in color, not black; he has not been taking
   his iron.  He also reports N/V and throwing up ""black specks"", no
   bright red blood, but this too has resolved.  He denies abdominal pain.
   .
   In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.7 P 108 BP 100/60 RR 20 O2 sat
   85%RA-->100%NRB.  CXR demonstrated a diffuse patchy opacity in the
   right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia with a possible second focus
   of pneumonia at the left lung base versus atelectasis.  There was also
   question of accompanying right parapneumonic effusion.  On exam he had
   guaic negative brown stool.  He received 2L NS and 1L  with 40meq KCL.
   Additionally, he received 750mg IV levofloxacin.  He was written for
   40meq PO KCL x2, but he did not tolerate the doses.
   .
   Patient is recently s/p ICU stay where he was continued on levaquin
   with steady improvement in his oxygenation.  Was called out to floor on
   3L NC.  On floor, triggered for hypoxia today with O2 requirement of 5L
   NC.  Aggressive suctioning, nebs, and chest PT was attempted.  This
   evening, patient was observed to be eating and aspirate on his meal.
   Thereafter desaturated to mid-80's on 100% NRB.  ICU transfer was
   initiated.
   .
   On arrival to ICU patient was chest pain free, requesting pain
   medications for LE neuropathy after transfer.  Patient not notably
   dyspneic, but desaturating to 70's on room air, 80's with speaking or
   removing his oxygenation.  ABG on floor prior to transfer 7.38/54/59/33
   on NRB.  Patient placed on BiPap - and satting 100% when wearing, but
   refusing to wear.  Then with repeated episodes of desaturation to
   mid-80's on NRB.  Patient was intubated.

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   Assessment and Plan:  68 y/o M admitted with pneumonia on [**Hospital 4659**]
   transferred to the ICU for desaturation on the floor in setting of
   aspiration.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  CXR with worsening bilateral airspace opacities
   R>L.  Hypoxia this PM most likely [**1-27**] aspiration given timing and h/o
   aspiration in past.  Patient ruled out for influenza this hospital
   stay.  No LE swelling to suggest PE, and not volume overloaded on exam
   to suggest heart failure.  Will add flagyl given possibility that
   initial pneumonia was aspiration event.
   - BiPap for now with consideration of intubation if unable to tolerate
   BiPap but currently satting well.
   - Levofloxacin for CAP -> add flagyl now
   - Urine legionella -> negative earlier this hospital stay
   - sputum culture -> resend now.
   - blood cultures -> resend now.
   - NPO except meds.
   - Check ECG, BNP
   .
   # Hypoxia:  Given infiltrates, appears to be in setting of pneumonia.
   Has chest discomfort with deep inspiration and with coughing and
   suspect musculoskeletal from coughing.  Have been able to wean off NRB
   and is currently maintaining O2 sats >93% on NC.
   - continue to wean supplemental O2 as possible
   .
   # N/V/diarrhea:  Reportedly resolved, zofran PRN.  continue to follow.
   - zofran prn
   - send stool if diarrhea returns

   Assessment and Plan
   24 year old woman with CKD V and severe hypertension due to SLE
   admitted with flare of chronic abdominal pain and hypertensive urgency.
   .
   Plan:
   1. Hypertensive urgency:
   - attempt to wean labetalol drip and give home PO meds if she can
   tolerate orals
   - contact renal in AM for scheduled HD
   .
   2. Abdominal pain: etiology unclear, though not a new issue for her; CT
   scan with bowel wall changes that are likely secondary to recent
   peritoneal dialysis and unrelated to pain
   - prn hydromorphone; attempt to give PO with prn antiemetics
   .
   3. CKD V from lupus nephritis:
   - contact renal in AM (on qMon/Wed/Fri hemodialysis this week, though
   usually dialyzed qTues/Thurs/Sat
   - cont home prednisone
   .
   4. History of SVC/subclavian vein thrombus; subtherapeutic INR (was
   also subtherapeutic on last admission)
   - heparin gtt to bridge until therapeutic on warfarin
   .
   5. Diarrhea: CT with evidence of mild colitis
   - check stool culture, C Diff toxin, O&P
   - no IVFs at this time since she appears euvolemic and is hypertensive
   .
   6. Anemia; slightly below baseline chronic anemia from epo-deficiency
   - Guaiac stools
   - recheck iron studies (last checked [**9-/2141**])

   Assessment and Plan
 DIARRHEA
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 DYSPNEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH)
   Assessment and Plan
   67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal tx on HD,
   recent admission for line sepsis, CAD, dCHF, hx PE, who presented to
   the ED with fevers and rigors and is transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension/concern for sepsis in the setting of HD, patient developed
   pulm edema leading to respiratory failure, pt intubated.
   # Type I/Type VI respiratory failure: Patient presented with
   hypotension and septic physiology. Given IVF to maintain pressures.
   Patient responded, however, became fluid overload. Unable to diurese.
   Gave morphine and SL nitro in attempt to vasodilate. Patient increased
   work of breathing with respiratory rate to 55. Respiratory failure
   likely caused by pulm edema and sepsis.
   - Intubated [**6-27**]
   - Renal [**Name (NI) 420**], will discuss HD to take fluid off
   - Fentanyl Versed sedation
   # Troponin-t: patient describes intermittent chest pain, labs show
   increased in troponin t, cardiology consulted
   - ASA
   - Metoprolol
   - Heparin
   - Atorvastatin
   # Sepsis:  Meets SIRS criteria with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea and
   line infection vs pneumonia vs c. diff as suspected source.  Was
   initially hypotensive but BP/MAPs stable now.  Initial report of
   purulent material oozing from entry site of left subclavian HD line but
   none seen on exam and only mild erythema.  Does have history of line
   sepsis however.   Pneumonia seems possible given ?hypoxia and cough
   though not clearly supported by CXR.  C. diff also possible given
   frequent BMs though no history of recent antibiotics.  Would also
   consider infected thrombus (has thrombosed fistula, SVC syndrome and
   prior PE), influenza, viral syndrome, UTI.  Was initially also c/o back
   pain prompting concern for osteo but currently denies.  Left femoral
   CVL in place.
   - Pull line if possible
   - IVF for UOP under 30, tachycardic
   - vanc, zosyn, flagyl Day 2
   - daily CXR
   - follow-up blood/sputum culture data (draw one set off HD line)
   - stool studies
   - will culture urine if possible (makes small amount of urine at
   baseline)
   - flu negative
   # ESRD, s/p failed kidney transplant:  Receives HD on MWF.  Renal aware
   of admission.
   - HD qMWF
   - continue nephrocaps, cinacalcet
   - continue low dose prednisone
   - epo with HD
   # DM: stable.
   - NPH and HISS
   # dCHF. No evidence of decompensation currently.
   - holding ACEI, BB in setting of sepsis
   # PE, SVC thrombus:  She was found to have a PE and SVC in [**1-30**] and
   started on warfarin.
   - Heparin
   - SCD

   [**Hospital 3526**] hospital, CT head was negative. CXR showed opacity in R
   hemithorax c/w layering R pleural effusion and pulmonary vascular
   congestion. Urine tox screen positive for benzos and TCAs. She was
   recently admitted [**Date range (1) 3533**] with abdominal pain, melena, and low Hct
   (33->23 in 1 wk).  She underwent EGD which showed grade II varices,
   portal gastropathy, and angioectasias in the antrum which were treated
   with thermal therapy.  She received 2 units PRBCs with Hct 23->29.  She
   also received an ultrasound guided paracentesis without evidence of

   gastric antral ectasia with varices but without an active source of
   bleed. Hct remained stable throughout admission.  During the last
   admission she was found to have an area of cellulitis at the area of an
   outpt Derm biopsy and she received Augmentin and Bactrim for 7 day
   course. Her U/A at that time was negative but grew out E coli sensitive
   to Bactrim.  She was due to follow up at [**Hospital1 5**] for repeat endoscopy.

   Assessment and Plan
   80yo man with a h/o multiple myloma on treatment with Revlamid
   (previously on decadron for a couple of years), SMV thrombosis,
   hyperlipidemia, CRI, peripheral neuropathy, pA fib on Warfarin, jaw
   osteonecrosis, melanoma of left thigh s/p resection / LN dissection at
   age 28, h/o superior mesenteric vein thrombosis and possible [**Known lastname **]
   vessel arterial disease, s/p colostomy in [**2143**] with chronic ostomy
   transferred from [**Hospital 108**] Hospital last night for an UGIB on
   anticoagulation and anti-platelet agents at [**Location (un) 108**] s/p EGD with
   cauterization and epinephrine.
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   No clinical e/o active GI bleeding. Hemodynamically stable. S/p a total
   of 3 units of pRBCs. Has OK access particularly given that there is not
   clinical e/o a brisk bleed. Working to normalize his INR with vitamin K
   and FFP. Will recheck Hct and INR later this morning to ensure
   stability of his counts. He continues on a protonix gtt
 anticipate
   changing to PPI [**Hospital1 **]. GI aware and will consult formally this morning.
   Per conversation last night, preference would be to re-scope rather
   than directly proceed to IR embolization. His platelets are not
   functioning normally given recent aspirin and Plavix; could consider
   DDAVP versus platelet transfusion if needed for re-bleeding.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Suspect ATN given hypotension at home. Renal U/S at OSH without acute
   findings beyond cortical thinning. Renal service aware of him, no
   indications for acute HD. Will support BP, follow UOP and creatinine.
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   Mild troponin leak without EKG changes or elevated CK. No indication
   for anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents at this time.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   Endorses adequate pain control on current dose of oxycodone. Follow
   clinically.

   dated [**2143-9-12**].
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2-13**] demonstrated: mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global
   systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
   is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild-moderate
   mitral regurgitation.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 89 y/o M with a PMH of CVA in [**2143**] with residual
   disordered breathing, DM type 2 presenting with four days of
   intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia
   .
   #. Chest Pain - The pt presents with hx of anterior chest discomfort
   occuring at rest for several days, similar to previous episodes which
   occurred during exercise. ECG with new RBBB and ST depressions
   throughout precordium. Symptoms are concerning for cardiac vs pulmonary
   etiology. Cardiac enzymes negative X2, D-dimer elevated.  TIMI score 3
   for age, RF and ST changes giving a 13% risk at 14 days of: all-cause
   mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring
   urgent revascularization. However given concurrent hypoxia, elevated
   D-dimer, and new RBBB also concern for PE.
   - Continue IV heparin
   - Continue Aggrenox
   - Continue lisinopril 2.5 mg daily
   - Trend CE - negative X2
   - Pt currently does not want to pursue cardiac catheterization, would
   consider stress testing following rule out of PE, improvement of
   hypoxia
   - Will start pre-contrast hydration for consideration of CTA this am
   .
   #. Hypoxia - The patient with hypoxia requiring NRB, currently weaned
   to 5L NC, no clear evidence of volume overload on exam. Pt has history
   of disordered breathing following stroke, has been off CPAP, also
   history of tobacco use, likely has underlying lung disease. Concern for
   PE as described above
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Discuss risk/benefit of CTA to rule out PE, if no CTA would pursue
   non-contrast Chest CT
   .
   #. Hx of CVA - resulting complex disordered breathing - pt has refused
   further treatment with CPAP or home O2 as outpatient
   - continue aggrenox
   .
   #. HTN - continue lisinopril
   .
   #. Type 2 diabetes - hold metformin while in house, start insulin SS
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid
   .
   #. FEN - NPO pending additional CE, then will start cardiac diet
   .

   was thought to be lying on the floor for > 24hrs (that
s when he was
   last seen).  Brought to [**Hospital3 **] via ambulance.  Originally
   alert and oriented [**12-26**] and conversive.  While at [**Hospital1 **], he developed
   stridor, and was intubated. He became hypotension and was started on
   peripheral dopamine. He received 1.5L of D5 with 100MEq HCO3, 1mg
   ativan, and zosyn prior to transport. CK [**Numeric Identifier 10228**].
   Arrived to [**Hospital1 5**] hypotensive and tachycardic.  Central access was
   obtained, a RIJ, confirmed placement by CXR.  Dopa changed over to
   levophed with improvement of VS.  Continued to receive IVF, almost 4l
   total in ED.  Found to have coffee grounds via OGT ~200cc
s, required
   2l lavage prior to clearing.
   Arrived to MICU 6 ~0200, levophed, fentanyl, versed, protonix and IVF
   infusing. Total 3liters D5.45NS with 50meq NaBicarb/liter infused.

Neuro: Pt. was on propofol  until she self extubated herself at 4:30 pm.  Off propofol she is alert and oriented and following commands.  Has R sided weakness from old stroke.  Also nods no sometimes when she means yes from stroke.  Moving all extremities.

CV: Remains on Nipride gtt of 1.7mcg/kg.  SBP has been mainly 140-160 via A line. Was started on her usual dose of Lopressor and Lisinopril but has not started Verapamil which she is on at home.  If she cannot wean off the Nipride plan is to start the po verapamil.  Surgery consulted re: possible aneurysm and determined that she does not have a dissecting aneurysm.

Resp: Pt self extubated at 4:30-she was on pressure support in anticipation of extubation.  She has done well-02 sats 97% on 50% face mask.  Breath sounds clear bilaterally.  Was suctioned for small amounts of thin, white sputum.

GI: OGT d/c'd with extubation.  Remains NPO.  Positive bowel sounds.  No stool.  HCT stable at 29 but gastric contents are ob positive.  No visible blood.

GU: foley intact.

Skin: intact.  R hand restrained to help stabalize A line.

Social: Family in to visit most of the day.  Met with MD and updated on plan.  Family has gone home for the evening.

A/P
-goal of BP is 140-maintain with nipride and possibly add verapamil
-evaluate pulmonary status with recent extubation.

   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 62 y.o. M s/p prostate biopsy, now presents with
   fever, hypotension, and elevated lactate, likely severe urosepsis.
   .
   # Severe Sepsis: Patient with fever and hematuria meets SIRS criteria
   with fever, hypotension, and 8% bands on OSH labs.  Likely source is
   prostatitis from biopsy and/or recent instrumentation.
   - Central venous line
   - Attempt A-line
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12, currently [**7-18**] s/p 8 L fluid
   - Transfuse for Hct > 21
   - IV fluid boluses and neosynephrine if needed to maintain MAP > 60 and
   UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures from OSH
   - Send blood and urine cultures now
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve
   - Broad coverage with Zosyn and Ciprofloxacin for anti-pseudomonal
   coverage and GNR coverage
   - Repeat lactate overnight
   .
   # Transaminitis: Elevated AST/ALT on admission labs. No others to
   compare prior to these. Consider liver derangements [**1-10**] sepsis.
   - trend LFTs
   .
   # Acute hematocrit drop: Hct 37.7 at OSH to 29.4. This may be
   dilutional; however, argument against this is WBC increased from 6.9 to
   9.0.  No active signs of GI bleeding, but patient states that he had
   some blood-streaked stool s/p biopsy
   - guiaic all stools
   - check Hct again in AM
   - active T&S
   - PIVs
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved after IVFs at OSH.
   - monitor Cr
   .
   # s/p Prostate Biopsy:
   - contact Dr. [**Name (NI) 4539**], pt's urologist, in AM
   - repeat UA and UCx now
   - may need to follow serial UAs for hematuria
   .

   CRITICAL CARE STAFF ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname 4540**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 272**], whose note reflects my
   input.  I would add/emphasize:
   62 y/o man prostate biopsy who has now developed high-grade fever,
   blood pressures in the 80s, and elevated lactic acid
 severe
   sepsis/septic shock, but has improved significantly with ~9L of
   fluids.  Suspect that he will grow GNR, and we will cover with a beta
   lactam and an aminoglycoside for now.  It is possible but less likely
   that he will develop a prostatic abscess; nonetheless, urology should
   see him today.
   He has several markers of high mortality risk (low platelets,
   hypotension after 20 cc/kg fluid bolus, elevated lactate) so requires
   critical care for now.  If he continues to improve, and we isolate a
   pathogen, would be reasonable to consider transfer out of critical care
   late today or tomorrow.
   Acute renal failure has improved.
   Transaminitis is of unclear etiology.  [**Month (only) 60**] simply be secondary to
   sepsis.  If not improved with recheck, will need further investigation.
   Other issues as per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 272**]
s note.
   Discussed with patient.  All questions answered.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 year old male with PMH of atrial fibrillation, alcohol
   abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, initially admitted with GIB,
   now with hypotension/tachycardia in setting of resolved GIB.
   #) Hypotension: Appears to become hypotensive when in afib with RVR,
   especially in the setting of treatment with beta-blockade. Was
   minimally responsive to IVF and appears to be volume replete after
   total 7L in last day. Pt
s hypotension correlated well w/ her
   metoprolol dose, and ended when the metoprolol wore off, even thought
   it was a small dose of 25mg once.
   - will try metop 12.5 once, and see how pt responds
   - will obtain Echo from [**Hospital1 609**] (if any), otherwise will obtain one here
   - if pt continues to become hypotensive, will try 1u PRBC
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB):  Resolved, no furthur
   bloody BMs. Pt
s Hct stable at 25 currently, do not suspect GIB as
   source of hypotension
   - continue PPI, trend [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   # Fever- low grade, tmax 100.3, latest CXR neg, Has new cough but
   otherwise does not act infected no WBCs.
   - CIS
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Not anticoagulated due to risk of falls.
   Unclear how often pt flipped into afib prior to this admission.  Had
   stopped amiodarone due to presumed noncompliance in setting of alcohol
   abuse.
   - LFT and TFT normal, PFT as outpt
   - consider restarting amiodarone drip and transition to PO vs digoxin.
   - consider cardiology consult as will need to f/u with cardiology.
   .
 .H/O ALCOHOL ABUSE: Has now been hospitalized x 8 days. No further
   need for CIWA monitoring.
   - Continue thiamine, folate, MVi
   .
   #) Tobacco abuse: Nicotine patches.

   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
   There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with akinesis of the mid- and distal septal segments, as
   well as of the apex and distal inferior wall. The remaining segments
   contract normally (LVEF = 40%), most c/w multivessel CAD. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve
   stenosis (valve area 1.1 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
   There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg) due to
   mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
   may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
   is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction, c/w CAD. Moderate aortic stenosis. Mild aortic
   regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
   regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   85 y o man with asthma, HTN, h/o CVA, admitted with respiratory
   distress, ischemic ECG changes and positive cardiac markers, ?ACS vs.
   demand ischemia
   1. Ischemia: ACS vs. demand, no clear source of demand, CXR with
   ?multifocal PNA, now worsening appearance, anemic on admission but Hct
   improved with transfusions.  Troponin slightly up this morning, CK-MB
   stable.  Unable to assess whether or not he is having CP [**3-1**] aphasia,
   but has not been c/o it at home.
   - Continue asa/plavix/heparin
   - Daily ECGs
   - F/up cardiology recs
   2.  Respiratory distress:   CXR suggestive of atypical pna, ?influenza
   despite neg swab. H/o asthma, exp wheezes that are more prominent
   centrally, scope by ENT w/out an upper airway source. ?TBM.  O2 needs
   coming down.
   - D/c vanco
   - Continue CTX + levo
   - Continue tamiflu x 5 days, cont flu precautions
   - F/up blood cultures
   - check urine legionella ag, mycoplasma serologies
   - continue nebs
   - ?IP evaluation for ?TBM once acute issues resolved
   3. Anemia: Hct 22 on admisison, improved to 33 p 2 units.  Likely
   chronic GIB given microcytosis.
   - continue to keep Hct > 30 given ACS vs. demand ischemia
   - if Hct stable here, will need outpt evaluation for anemia/GIB with
   scopes
   4. Renal failure: appears acute on chronic per records from PCP.

   Assessment and Plan
   1- Right LE cellulitis/vascular insufficiency ? wet gangrene:
   WIll cover broadly with Meropenem, gentamycin , and vancomycin. monitor
   levels. Vascular to take to OR for amputation tomorrow am.
   2- GNR bacteremia: On vano/merepenem, received [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] add dose of
   gent. likely source is RLE vs abdominal source, less likely line
   infection
   3- Hemodynamic monitoring: patient has PICC line placed [**8-12**], she
   required blood pressure monitoring with invasive arterial line, as it
   is no possible to measure a BP non invasively currently, especially in
   light of her GNR bacteremia, and altered mental status, and elevated
   lactate. Cannot rule out shock currently. After discussion with renal
   team and vascular surgery team best option for invascive A-line access
   is her right brachial artery, as she has no right radial pulse/artery
   on ultrasound, she has a fistula in the left arm, s/p amputation of
   left leg, with clot in femoral arterial on left, and infected, ischemic
   right leg with plan for amputation there in am. This carries a risk of
   ischemia to the right hand, we discussed this risk with her HCP
   daughter [**Name (NI) 10400**], and she understands it and agrees to proceed.
   4- Altered mental status: will need to rule out hypoperfusion by
   placing arterial line and starting resuscitation.

   negative, can stop antibiotics.  Other likely scenario is that
   she had some emotional distress from headache and news about her
   transplant status, and then she was medicated with morphine and

   HPI:
   78 M with history of CAD s/p BMS to LAD in [**2111**] presenting from [**Hospital1 2096**] with STEMI.
   Mr [**Known lastname 10255**] reports that he was in his usual state of health until the
   night of admission, when he developed sudden back pain and a feeling of
   ""being squeezed by two linebackers"" when he woke up to use the
   bathroom. (+) Diaphoresis, nausea, no syncope or light-headedness. This
   pain was then associated with right arm tingling, all the same as his
   presenting symptoms in [**2111**]. He has not had any anginal episodes since
   his last stent placement 12 years ago.
   .
   At [**Hospital1 **], patient was initially treated as NSTEMI then developed into
   anterior STEMI. Started on heparing gtt, integrillin gtt and given ASA
   and Plavix. Transferred to [**Hospital1 5**], in cath lab found to have TO RCA,
   unable to cross with wire and felt to be chronic given the lack of ECG
   changes to the inferior segment. Had tight LAD which was stented with 2
   BMS with restoration of good flow. Of note he developed a large groin
   hematoma after femoral puncture with extravasation of contrast under
   fluoro; femoral stop placed with successful cessation of oozing.
   Transferred to CCU for further management.
   .
   On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
   venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
   myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
   He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. Hhe denies exertional
   buttock or calf pain. Of note, patient has dental procedures scheduled
   in the near future. Also, he has develped a rash in his back for which
   he was started on Prednisone 60mg daily for approximately one week. All
   of the other review of systems were negative.
   .
   Cardiac review of systems is notable per HPI, denies dyspnea on
   exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
   palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 M with CAD with prior LAD BMS developed anterior STEMI, s/p 2 BMS to
   LAD with course c/b right groin hematoma with fem stop in place
   .
   # CORONARIES: 2 vessel disease with presumed chronically occluded RCA,
   now s/p BMS x 2 on LAD.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Plavix 75mg daily for at least one month
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - If blood pressure allows, will start low dose beta blocker and
   ace-inhibitor.
   .
   # PUMP: There is question of systolic dysfunction after prior MI,
   however patient without any symptoms of heart failure and on no heart
   failure medications. Nonetheless, given the occluded RCA and new
   anterior MI, will need to evaluate EF.
   - ECHO today
   - Euvolemic, s/p contrast load, no role for diuretics.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Sinus rhythm
   .
   # Right groin hematoma: Stable, will need to continue applied pressure
   and close monitoring.
   - continue fem stop
   - no integrillin
   - Q8H Hct
   - Active type and screen
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: per history not optimally controlled, regardless
   needs high dose statin in peri-stemi period.
   .
   #  Rash: Unclear etiology, unable to assess at this time given bedrest
   from cath. Although no randomized trial data is available to support
   increased cardiovascular risk of corticosteroids, observational data
   ([**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Int med [**2118**]) would suggest significant increase in risk and
   therefore would not continue steroids at this time. Given short
   duration of therapy, highly unlikely to develop adrenal insufficiency
   - Monitor for signs of Adrenal insufficiency (eos, abd pain,
   hypotension, hyperkalemia)
   - Hold steroids

   EEG [**2144-4-24**]:
   This is an abnormal 24-hour video EEG due to multiple prolonged periods
   of disorganized generalized spike and slow wave discharges without
   clinical correlate indicative of non-convulsive status epilepticus.
   During periods of more normal-appearing background EEG, the rhythm was
   mildly slow indicative of mild to moderate encephalopathy, which may be
   seen with infections, medication effect or toxic metabolic
   abnormalities.

   MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAS
   No acute infarction. No focal lesions in the brain parenchyma to
   suggest neoplastic or infectious etiology. Nonspecific white matter
   changes in the cerebral white matter on both sides, likely due to
   sequelae of chronic small vessel occlusive disease, with other
   etiologies being less likely, due to lack of IV contrast enhancement.
   Assessment and Plan
   75 y/oF with T Cell Lymphoma with CNS involvment with recurrent status
   epilepticus, non-convulsive, transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further
   management. Phenobarbital is indicated, and we have discussed with
   neurology on call, pharmacy, and anesthesia regarding elective
   intubation for phenobarbital management, airway protection. Have also
   discussed this with the son, who is okay with trial on intubation and
   phenobarb. Risks of intubation have been discussed with the family.
         Status Epilepticus: cause likely related to TCL in CNS
   - elective intubation for phenobarb. 20mg/kg IV x1, (1500mg given 75kg
   weight). BMT fellow paged to be made aware of this decision, reached
   with resident, RN, pharmacy, and intensivist overnight.
   - Rechecked dilantin level in [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] and calculated out that her
   corrected dilantin was 15.6.  Aiming for between 16-18, will re-bolus
   her an additional 150mg in addition to her scheduled 100mg to achieve a
   higher trough.
   Her access is also fully utilized now for bicarb infusion, dilantin
   presently, and will need access for sedation for vent.
   Will continue LeVETiracetam 1000 mg IV Q8HR
   receiving steroids
   Will try and add on beta-2microglobulin,LDH,protein, VZV/HSV to CSF if
   quantity sufficient.
   Neurology to continue following.
   She is on antibiotics given low grade fevers, on vanc/cefepime.  She is
   on acyclovir as well.
   Treatment course undefined as present, likely to be continued as counts
   drop though. Will d/w BMT team in AM.
         T Cell Lymphoma:
   - Received CHOP, MTX, IT cytarabine
   - For MTX, continuing to alkalanize the urine, and following levels.
   continuing on leucovorin
   - Counts are dropping, will follow CBC and ANC.
         Hypertension:
   - Currently NPO, not receiving meds
   - Following for now, can address hypertension with PRN hydralazine if
   needed
         Electrolyte Abnormalities
   - K, Mg repletion as needed

   Chief Complaint:  Respiratory failure
   HPI:
   A 54 year-old female with history of alcohol abuse, status post
   splenectomy, status post multiple abdominal surgeries initially
   presenting with altered mental status. The patient's mother states that
   the patient had been on an alcohol binge for a few days without
   significant PO intake. She has been complaining of poorly localized
   abdominal pain over the past few weeks, but did not complain about
   worsening. The mother was checking on her during the day early this
   morning found the patient complaining of difficulty breathing. The
   patient subsequently became confused and was not responding
   appropriately to questions. The mother called EMS to bring the patient
   to the ED, and she was noted to be obtunded in the ambulance.
   On arrival to the ED at 04:23, vitals were T 96.9 HR 121 BP 82/48 RR 20
   SaO2 99%RA, FSG 18. The patient was given at least 2 amps D50 with
   improvement in mental status. At 07:20, the patient subsequently
   complained of fatigue/malaise with her nurse in the room and became
   unresponsive. The patient was asystolic. During the code the patient
   received epinephrine x 7, atropine x 3, calcium x 2, magnesium x 2,
   narcan x 2. A femoral line was placed and the patient was given 2-4L of
   saline. She was coded for 26 minutes, with final return of a perfusing
   rhythm with pulses 07:56.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 54 year-old female with history of alcohol abuse, status post
   splenectomy, status post multiple abdominal surgeries initially
   presenting with altered mental status and dyspnea, with subsequent
   asystolic arrest for 26 minutes and multiple laboratory abnormalities,
   including significant bandemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated
   lactate.
   * Status post arrest: The patient had a 26 minute asystolic arrest in
   the ED. The most likely etiologies are acidosis versus potential toxin
   ingestion. The patient was no longer hypoglycemic at the time of
   arrest. Her examination at this time is significant for minimally
   responsive dilated pupils, negative gag reflex, decerebrate posturing,
   no response to pain. The length of the code suggests a poor prognosis.
   - Initiate cooling protocol
   - EEG
   - Stat CT head when feasible
   - Neurology consult; appreciate
   - Treatment for potential underlying etiologies as below
   * Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has renal failure, a
   significant lactic acidosis, as well as ketones likely due to
   dehydration. Her osmolar gap initially was only 11, however increased
   to 17 on repeat testing, of unclear etiology. Acidosis is improving a
   bicarbonate drip.
   - IVF hydration
   - Continue bicarbonate drip
   - Continue to monitor lactate
   - Toxicology consult; appreciate
   - Evaluation for sepsis as below
   * Sepsis: Unclear etiology - patient is status post splenectomy and
   therefore immunocompromised. Initial laboratories significant for WBC
   12.9 with 32% bandemia. Concern for catastrophic abdominal event given
   gas distended bowel loops and recent complaints of abdominal pain.
   Initial chest x-ray and urinalysis without infection.
   - Antibiosis with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole to treat
   likely abdominal process
   - Stat CT torso
   - Blood, sputum, urine, stool cultures pending
   - Surgery following; appreciate
   * Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia to the 140s. Unclear etiology
   patient now febrile; also concerning for sepsis, hypovolemia, and
   alcohol withdrawal.
   - Tylenol
   - IVF hydration
   - Consider benzodiazepine for alcohol withdrawal
   * Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Intubated initially in the setting of
   a code.
   - Continue supportive ventilation with goal to compensate for her
   profound metabolic acidosis from a ventilatory standpoint
   * Acute renal failure: Initially appears pre-renal in the setting of
   poor PO and FeNa 0.4. The patient may progress to ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.
   - IVF hydration
   - Continue to monitor
   * Anemia: The patient
s baseline hematocrit is 32 and was 25 on
   admission. Hematocrit has now dropped to 21, likely in the setting of
   dilution.  Hemolysis labs negative. Guaiac negative on admission.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Active type and cross
   - Continue to monitor
   * EtoH abuse: Concern for alcohol withdrawal as above.
   - Thiamine, folate, MVI
   - Consider
   * Hyponatremia: Hypovolemic hyponatremia. Improved with fluids.
   - Recheck laboratories
   * Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. The patient had recently been
   drinking significant amounts of alcohol, which was likely responsible.
   - Q2H FSG for now
   * Polysubstance abuse: History ofalcohol abuse as above. Urine positive
   for cocaine

   - Abdominal CT with rectal contrast when physiologically stable.
   - Antiemetics
   - Rectal tube for decompression
   - Will hold bowel regimen until volvlus ruled out.
   - Surgery following
   - No fever indicating bowel pathology; will hold ABX at this time.
   # Demand ischemia versus NSTEMI: Currently BP stable, CP free.
   Troponin to .17, will trend over the next day.  CKs flat.  EKG changes
   appear to be resolving on repeat tests. Changes appear similar to
   changes on prior EKGs during NSTEMI.
   - Repeat EKG
   - Trend tropnins
   - If tropnin and CKs positive, will consider plavix but avoiding at
   this time given low likelihood of true NSTEMI and possible
   surgery/colonoscopy if volvulus exists.
   - Patient anticoagulated on warfarin; no need for heparin at this time
   - SL nitro for chest pain; will maintain chest-pain free.
   - Already on ASA, simvastatin, [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] consider increasing metoprolol

   statin, HTN; admit with rhabdomyolysis, ARF on CKD, hyperkalemia, and
   respiratory alkalosis.
   # Rhabdomyolysis.  CK 34K on admission.  DDx includes statin use,
   hypothyroidism, electrolyte abnormalities (hypoK, hypophos), muscle
   injury (s/p fall a week ago).  No evidence of crush injury, seizure,
   NMS causing meds, EtOH or other drug abuse.  Patient also with strange
   history of rule out for pheo - ?mildly elevated free normetanephrines
   (had hypertensive response to beta blocker during last admission;
   unclear of subsequent workup).   Rhabdo of unclear duration; has not
   noted change in urine (though now frankly red/brown); muscle weakness
   is subacute complaint.  CKs normal during [**Month (only) 270**] admission.
   -          D/C statin.

   -          IVFs to maintain UOP; avoid hypotension.
   -          Management of renal failure below.
   -          Check TFTs to rule out hypothyroidism.
   # ARF on CKD. Baseline CKD thought to be due to DM and HTN.  Insult
   from rhabdo as above.  Likely also hypovolemic.
   -          IVFs at 125-150/h (avoiding bicarb as long as pH stays
   elevated)
   -          Q4-6 hour lytes
   -          Renal aware; patient aware that may need initiation of
   short/long term HD this admission to management volume status, K,
   acidosis.  Will discuss line placement.
   -          Hold [**Last Name (un) 284**] for now.
   -          Avoid hypotension.
   #  Hyperkalemia.  With ARF as above.  Down to 4.1 in ED.
   -          frequent lyte checks as above.
   -          Kayexalate, lasix prn (may need more tonight as effects of
   insulin/dextrose and bicarb wear off.
   -          Monitor on tele
   #  Generalized weakness.  Mild proximal weakness on exam, otherwise
   nothing focal.  Likely related to rhabdo as above.
   -          trend CKs.
   -          Check LFTs.
   # Respiratory alkalosis.  pH 7.68 in ED.  Compensating for metabolic
   acidosis but hyperventilating in addition.
   -          repeat ABG/VBG
   -          Ativan prn anxiety as per home regimen.
   -          Salicylates negative.
   # Metabolic acidosis.  AG 21 in ED.  Likely renal failure related.
   Ketones negative, lactate slightly elevated.
   -          recheck ABG and lactate.
   -          Treatment of renal failure.
   # Elevated Troponin.  No symptoms of ACS.  Likely renal failure and
   muscular breakdown.  Mild inferior PR depressions otherwise no ECG
   changes.  MBI normal.
   -          continue to trend.
   # Leukocytosis.  To 13K.  Also with mild leukocytosis during last
   admission.  No fever or focal signs of infection.
   -          hold off on further abx.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 6263**] is a 60 yo M, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 54**] on [**2128-10-11**]
   after a VATS w/LLL Wedge resection [**10-6**].  His recent admission was
   complicated by hypoxia, a pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement and
   removal and then urinary retention which ultimately resolved.  He was
   discharged home with VNA services to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
   Oncology as an outpatient.
   .
   Today, a VNA came to change his dressings. She found that the patient
   was slightly hypotensive with SBP 80's and hypoxic and called an
   ambulance. The patient himself states that has been feeling a little
   anxious and shaky but feels normal. He states that the nurse
   over-reacted as his SBP typically runs 90's and that he requires oxygen
   at baseline. He denies any changes in his health in the past few days,
   denies taking additional dilauded, no fevers, no chills, no coughing, +
   vomiting on the day after discharge, but no subsequent vomiting, nausea
   or diarrhea. He endorses left lateral/flank chest pain [**1-17**] recent
   incisions but denies substernal or ""heart"" pain. No dyspnea. He denies
   any sensation of lightheadedness or syncope.
   .
   In the ED: The patient had no complaints. Thoracic surgery saw the
   patient and remarked that he was more hypoxic than baseline. Per
   thoracic's his baseline is O2 88-91% 4-5L NC, BP 90's, nl PCo2 50's.
   Vitals signs in the ED were SBP 80's->90's spontaneously, O2 saturation
   92% on NRB,low 80's on 6L NC, temp 101.0.  CXR clear. Started on Vanc
   and Zosyn. He was given fluids. EKG showed deeper ST depressions and
   TWI inversion, trop 0.6 - > started on heparin for ACS vs PE. A
   non-contrast CT showed  The patient was also found to have renal

   Imaging: Cardiac Cath [**4-/2128**]:
   1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed minimal
   disease of the LMCA, widely patent prior LAD stents, mild restenosis of
   OM1, and 100% occluded RCA that fills via LCx collaterals.
   2.  Arterial bypass angiography revealed 100% occluded SVG->R-PDA.
   3.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated and equalized right and left
   sided filling pressures with RVEDP, mean PCWP, and LVEDP of 20 mm Hg.
   PASP was severely elevated at 71 mm Hg.  Systemic arterial pressure was
   moderately elevated.  Cardiac index was preserved at 2.7 l/min/m2.
   4.  Left ventriculography revealed 1+ mitral regurgitation and LVEF of
   50% with inferior hypokinesis.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Patent prior LAD stent, mild restenosis of OM1 stent.
   3. Occluded SVG-->R-PDA.
   4. Severely elevated right heart pressures and pulmonary hypertension.
   5. Equalization of left and right sided filling pressures with possible
   restrictive vs. constrictive physiology.
   .
   Echo [**2128-10-7**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous
   echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging
   are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction.
   with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
   motion/position. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
   aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 30
   cm from the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   .
   CT chest/abd [**2128-10-14**]:No evidence of focal fluid collection in the
   abdomen or pelvis to suggest an abscess. No evidence of hematoma in the
   chest, abdomen or pelvis. Mild compressive atelectasis is seen in the
   left lower lobe subjacent to a trace left pleural effusion. The patient
   is status post left VATS wedge resection of a spiculated left lower
   lobe pulmonary nodule. Note is made of subcutaneous air along the
   anterolateral left chest wall.

   FINDINGS: There are no focal liver lesions. There is normal hepatopetal
   flow within the main portal vein. The gallbladder has a 6 x 6 x 6 mm
   nonobstructive shadowing gallstone. The gallbladder is not distended,
   and no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid is present.
   The common bile duct is normal measuring 5 mm. There is no free
   abdominal fluid. There is no intra- or extra- hepatic biliary
   dilatation. The spleen is enlarged but stable measuring 17 cm.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
   2. Stable splenomegaly.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Resolved hypotension: Unclear etiology. Patient has evidence of
   multisystem organ failure with  mildly elevated lipase, elevated trop,
   ARF and transaminitis. The patient does not have any history of N/V/D
   to cause hypovolemia and has been off of lasix. He does not have septic
   physiology at this time. His HCT is stable and there is no bleeding to
   suggest hemorrhage. It is possible that heart failure with elevated BNP
   could result in hypotension. In addition, the patient may be having an
   AMI that could impair cardiac output although he does not appear to be
   in cardiogenic shock and a trop of 0.6 is not high enough to be
   concerned about a large MI. A PE could cause hypotension, trop lead and
   EKG changes. The patient does appear to have a history of syncope with
   MOF this past [**2128-3-16**].

   # Resolved hypoxia: Patient now at baseline oxygenation. CT chest
   showed atelectasis no infiltrate. Pt also does not have fever or sputum
   production to suggest PNA although WBC is slightly elevated with left
   shift. CTA could not be performed given ARF. The patient does have hx
   severe diastolic heart failure and elvated BNP, but there is no
   pulmonary edema, JVD or crackles on exam to suggest volume overload at
   this time.

   # Transaminitis: AST and ALT elevated w/o rise in alk phos or bili. RUQ
   unrevealing. INR 1.8  suggesting coagulopathy. The patient had a very
   similar episode of hypotension, renal failure and transaminitis in
   [**2128-3-16**] in which he was diagnosed with shock liver. Viral hepatitis
   can elevated AST/ALT to this extent. Medication overdose, tylenol may
   cause transaminitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   /P:69 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM2, recent
   MRSA bacteremia, COPD s/p trach, CKD, originally admitted to the ICU
   with altered mental status found to have UTI, partial SBO and acute
   renal failure now being transferred back to the ICU for ventilator
   support
   .
   # Acute on chronic Respiratory Failure - s/p trach 03/[**2139**]. Was
   originally on face mask. Now more acedemic likely seconday to renal
   failure and not able to compensate. Also, not moving much air likley
   secondary to COPD exacerbation. CXR unchanged. She does not appear
   overtly volume overloaded despite being oliguric.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed.
   - Continue prednisone  - 60mg daily
 plan for long taper
   - Restart on vent with goal pH of 7.2, no improvement with PSV will
   continue AS for now
   - Hold on IVF at this point and reserve only for hypotension
   - Continue po bicarb
   - Monitor VBG
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8 prior to last
   admission, however on last discharge Cr was 4.2 (felt to be her new
   baseline).  During that admission rise in creatinine was attributed to
   ATN.  She was also noted to have positive urine eos and cetazadime was
   discontinued.  Also noted to have renal mass on CT. Originally given
   IVF on admission with no improvement. Now with continued worsening
   renal function and acidemia (creatinine 7.0). Dialysis has been
   discussed but to felt to be needed urgently.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - conrrect acid-base disturbance as much as possible with vent
   - d/c IV HCO3 for now
   - In speaking with the family today, the are still interested in
   dialysis
   .
   # UTI: History of bad panresistant infections.  She had VRE (sensitive
   to linezolid) and cefepime resistant nonfermenter nonpseudomonas
   (sensitive to cipro) on urine culture dated [**6-29**].  Positive UA with mod
   leuk, pos nit.    Elevated WBC count, currently afebrile.  BP stable.
   Lactate within normal limits. Urine culture with enterobacter sensitive
   to meropenum
   - continue meropenum for presumed UTI
   .
   # Altered mental status: On admission patient was somnolent but
   responding to commands.  According to team she is only slightly more
   somnolent than her prior baseline. Head CT negative for evidence of
   bleed. AMS likely due to infection given negative head CT. Now she does
   not follow commands, barely opens eyes to sternal rub.  Likely
   multifactorial including infection, renal failure. Consider status
   epillepticus, but less likely given does intermittently wake up and has
   other reasons for altered mental status.
   - Hold sedating medications including Fentanyl patch
   - Treat urinary tract infection
   - if no improvement, consider EEG
   .
   # Small bowel obstruction: Partial SBO noted on CT scan from outside
   hospital.  Seen by surgery in the ED - nonoperative candidate, NG tube
   placed.  Abdominal exam notable for distension, nontender, diminished
   BS, now soft with + BS
   - Serial abdominal exams, continue NGT
 clinically improving
   - NPO as diet, IVF PRN
   - Need to address nutritional status with family as patient had
   declined tube feeds in the past
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Troponin of 1.51 on admission to ED in setting of increased
   creatinine.  Case discussed with cardiology who did not feel
   intervention necessary at this time.  At this point timing of event is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 278**] echo on [**6-29**] showed EF 50-55%, repeat on [**7-22**] no new
   focal wall motion abnormalities, but suboptimal study.  Currently
   denies CP.
   - Continue beta blocker, aspirin
   .
   # Seizures:
   - Continue trileptal
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus:
   - FS QID, continue on RISS
   .
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure:
   - Continue beta blocker at slightly decreased dose.  Titrate up as
   tolerated to home dose.
   - Monitor volume status
   .
   # Hypertension: Has been intermittently hypotensive.
   - DC hydral and diltiazem for low BP
   - continue BB
   .
   #. Nutrition: As of last discharge the patient was currently tolerating
   minimal po intake with PMV. Speech and swallow cleared patient for
   taking meds crushed in purees and small amounts of puress and ice chips
   whicle trach collar in place with cuff deflated and PMV in place.
   There was a family discussion and patient declined placement of Dobhoff
   or PEG tube. Now the patient's family is saying that they want her to
   get TFs and possibly a PEG tube.  This will need to be readdressed.
   Plan for additional family meeting

   # PPx: PPI, heparin subq, bowel regimen

   Pt has been in NSR w/ HR in the 90s and SBP >100. HR down into the 80s
   after IV Lopressor given. Heparin dose increased to 1200units/hr from
   500units/hr and Pt also given oral aspirin. Amiodarone infusing at
   .5mg/min.  No ectopy noted. Palpable DP/PT pulses bilaterally.
   Action:
   Lopressor increased w/ aim of HR to be in the 60-70rs. Heparin
   increased to achieve therapeutic PTT(60-80)
   Response:
   10mg IV Lopressor resulted in HR decreasing from 90s-80s. Oral
   Lopressor started.  Awaiting response.
   Plan:
   Check cardiac enzymes at 12pm, PTT to be checked at 3pm. Plan for
   transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name 247**] for cardiac catheterization and to be followed
   by CCU and surgical teams.  Monitor as ordered.
   Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)
   Assessment:
   Pt c/o abdominal pain, pain which he also describes as being under his
   lower ribs, and pain which he points to his right clavical area. He has
   described the pain that he felt when he had an MI as radiating down his
   arm and that what he is experiencing is different.  Pain increases with
   movement and breathing. Pt is using dilaudid PCA, but has not maximized
   usage.  Describes feeling
fuzzy
 when he increases his use, but no
   significant pain relief.
   Action:
   Instructed Pt about deep breathing and splinting.  Encouraged to use
   PCA as tolerated.

This is a 51 yo male who went to the EW 12 days ago c/o abd pain n/v/d.  Dx with diverticulitis, CT found an abcess and a drain was placed, WBC increased and an additional CT showed another abcess - a second drain was placed, blood clx showed pseudamonas - abx were changed.  Yesterday he had a sigmoid colectomy and a SB resection.  His EBL was 400 - he rec 4500cc during surgery, post op HCT was 39.  During the night he was hypotensive 80-90s, tachycardic, received 4800cc over the night, he was transfered here for further care.

Systems Review:

CV:  BP 100-1teens, HR 100-120s, started on lopressor 5 mg Q6hr and he tolerated this well - brought his SBP from the high 120s to the low 100s, his dose was increased to 7.5mg q6hr.  He was given a bolus of MS04 to see if decreasing his pain would decrease his HR; it did not.

Resp:  LS clear, ATs remain 95% on 2 L NC.  He has been using the incentive inspirometer q1hr.

GI:  Pt conts to c/o abd pain but this has been decreasing through the day.  On arrival he was [**2166-9-23**], his PCA was increased to 1.5 q6 min and he was given the bolus above, at 5 pm his pain was a 3.  His abd is soft, hypoactive BS, 35 cc of sero sang fluid out from his JP drain.  Remains NPO.

GU:  He was initially putting out 70-100cc urine/hr, it decreased to the 20s, picked up to the 40s, his IV was then increased from 150 to 200cc/hr with some effect.

Ms. [**Known lastname 4098**] is a 69 y/o female who is chronically trached/vented, transfered from [**Hospital1 894**] with resp distress and trach leak. Pt was bronched in ED and found to have 98% obstruction by granulation tissue and an ulceration into posterior tracheal membrane. Pt was then transfered to MICU for further treatment. She needs to have to CTA of chest to determine what will be done next, although is unstable at this time to lie flat as she has large leak and loses volumes when flat or being turned. Pt will possibly have CTA on Monday.

Pt significant h/o COPD, CHF, lung CA s/p RUL lobectomy.

NEURO: Pt is alert, sleeping on/off t/o shift. Pt follows commands and can lift her hands to face. No movement observed in lower extremities, although pt is extremely edematous, weaping from all extremities.
Pt did c/o pain all over, esp in back. Medicated with 25mcg of Fentanyl with good effect.

CV: NSR 70s-80s, no ectopy observed. BP 90s-100s/30s-40s. Palpable pulses bilaterally. Lytes wnl.

RESP: Pt is trached/vented with larger air leak. MVs [**3-6**] and TVs 300-500, but fluctuate often depending on pt's position. Pt was initially on AC 50%/500/14/5, but RT thought that she would maintain better volumes on PS mode. Pt was changed over to CPAP+PS 50%/15/5, and does seem to be tolerating better but large air leak continues to be an issue. ABG 7.39/58/85/36. RR 16-25, sats90-97%. Suctioning thick bloody secretions. LS are coarse with crackles in bases. Pt on solumedrol for COPD.

GI: ABD is obese, +BS, no BM this shift. Pt is passing flatus. Pt is NPO.

GU: Foley is draining minimal clear yellow urine, 20-80cc/hr. Pt may to be diuresed as she is on 40mg lasix [**Hospital1 **] at baseline, BP has been borderline since admission.

ID: Pt has been afebrile. Pt was started on Ceftaz at [**Hospital1 894**] for ? PNA.

SKIN: Pt is extremely edematous, weaping large amounts of fluid in all extremities. Arms and legs wrapped in soft sorb pads. Left hand has large open area, with surrounding skin necrotic looking and weaping large aerous drainage. Open area covered with aqua-cel and wrapped in cling.

SOCIAL: Pts husband [**Name (NI) 1706**] and sons were here on pt's admission and were updated by [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 30**] and this RN. Their contact numbers are on board in room.

PLAN: Pt to have CTA when able to lie flat, to determine further course of treatment. Continue to monitor Pts volumes and sats. Pt will probably need some diuresis for fluid overload and low u/o.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 74 year old lady with a recent PNA and dirty U/A returns for altered
   mental status and evidence of a possible aspiration PNA.
   #. Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  The patient has an unclear history
   of COPD vs possible restrictive disease given her CXR.  Regardless, she
   has developed worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure likely due to
   atelectasis, deconditioning and a possible new PNA.  She does not
   appear to be volume overloaded at this time.
   - Treat ? underlying PNA
   - Continue BiPap ventillation
   - Prepare for nocturnal bipap on d/c
   - No indication for intubation at this time
   - Continue home Prednisone 5mg PO BID
   - Nebs q2
   - Obtain further records/history in AM
   #. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely
   secondary to her hypercarbia, with possible contribution from infection
   and hypoglycemia.  As we have corrected these underlying conditions her
   mental status is clearing.  Head CT negative, no focal abnormalities on
   neuro exam.
   - Monitor mental status
   - Treat underlying causes as described.
   #. ?Pneumonia: The patient's CXR is suggestive of possible retrocardiac
   PNA, but definitely of small lung volumes
   - Continue Vanc Cefepime given Pen Allergy
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis secondary
   to chronic metabolic acidosis and possibly from volume contraction.
   - Volume resuscitation with NS titrated to UOP > 50 hour
   - Q6 electrolytes
   #. Hypernatremia: The patient is hypernatremic to 150, likely
   representing hypovolemia due to poor PO intake while altered.  Total
   free water deficit is 2.6 L which can be corrected over the next 20
   hours.
   - D5W at 125mL for 2.5L
   - Q6 lytes
   #. DM II/Hypoglycemia: Patient hypoglycemic, likely from poor PO
   intake.
   - D5W per hypernatremia
   - SS insulin, no fixed doses
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled
   - Continue Metoprolol and Warfarin, hold Diltiazem for now

   Pt progress discussed on rounds.  Altered mental status seems to be
   related to dehydration from poor nutrition and several metabolic
   abnormalities.  PNA unlikely , will stop Abx today.  Concern for
   expressive aphasia on exam.  Unclear baseline.  Will talk to previous

   Assessment and Plan
   64 year old woman with MM, [**Doctor Last Name **]-amyoid, multiple DVT's, ESRD,
   hypercalcemia and refractory pain. Plan as per resident note. briefly,
   per oncology appears to have exhausted
   her treatment options and know has refractory hypercalcemia as well as
   multipl organ involvement of amyloid. Declining functional status. No
   strong evidence of new infection though perhaps
   some progression of R peri-hilar consolidation on CT. Suspect
   hypotenison is mild hypovolemia on top of baseline low CO [**2-26**] amyloid.
   Mentating well off pressors with MAP 50-55. Would
   continue to titrate to that goal. Access is an issue given multiple
   clots and will go to IR for PICC this afternoon. Respiratory status is
   stable but marginal. Reasonable to continue empiric
   rx for HAP though I suspect much of her dyspnea in due to amyloid.
   Pan-culture. The team has spoken to the oncology team and there are
   ongoing discussions about goals of care. Vit. K for
   INR > 7 and history of head bleed. Further plans as per resident note.
   Once off pressors, reasonable to transfer to primary oncology team.

   Attending: I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present

   agree with the note above, including the assessment and plan and would
   add the following:
   64yo woman with multiple myeloma, s/p allogeneic transplant [**2143**] with
   recurrent disease and with systemic amyloidosis, on hemodialysis for
   ESRD.  She was admitted [**Date range (1) 7152**]/08 with hypercalcemia and treated
   with pamidronate 30mg, calcitonin, and dialysis (complicated by an
   episode of hypotension following HD).  She was started on Revlimid last
   week for her amyloidosis. At home, she has been increasing her O2 to 5
   liters to treat dyspnea. Pt was admitted today with acute on chronic
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and recurrent all over body pain. Has
   remained hypotensive with BP in the 70s despite good mentation. For
   difficult access, a PICC line was placed.
   Exam is as above. Labs significant for wbc 3.0, hct 32, inr 7.2, lytes
   wnl, LDH 961 (up from 246), ALT 551, AST 876, CK 122, Trop-t 0.95, Ca
   14.2, lactate 2.8.
   Patient is critically ill. She now has hepatitis and apparently NSTEMI
   in the context of hypotension of unclear etiology. Hypotension in part
   due to aggressive new dry weight in context of reduced PO intake. LV
   systolic function is preserved but there is a mild diastolic
   dysfunction on today
s echo. The hypercalcemia will be treated with
   pamidronate and decadron. This may be adrenal insufficiency due to hx
   of steroids and less likely, a rare side effect of Revlimid.  I agree,
   she does not appear to be septic.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ h/o congenital deafness, HTN, DM, CAD, osteoarthritis and L
   subclavian steal syndrome admitted s/p ERCP for cholangitis c/b ARF and
   respiratory failure.  Stable and transferred to floor
 now readmitted
   intubated s/p hypoxic respiratory arrest in the setting of aspiration
   [**12-21**] bowel obstruction from head of pancreas.  Has severe septic shock
   and ARDS.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS:  This is in the setting of
   worsening tachypnea over the last few days.  This is likely due to
   intermittent aspiration with a large-volume aspiration event this am.
   Bronch showed bilious pus in major airways.  Meets ARDS criteria.
   - ARDSnet protocol
   - F/U bronchial washings
   - Broad antibiotic coverage for aspiration PNA
 vanc/zosyn/gent/fluc
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   #Septic shock: Aspiration PNA, pancreatitis, bowel microperf are
   potential sources.  On 2 pressors.
   - F/U cx
   - Continue vanc/gent/zosyn/fluc and follow-up with ID consult team
   - Wean norepi then vasopressin as tolerated
   - Follow CVP, cVO2 sat and titrate IVF
   - Cycle enzymes and EKGs to r/o cardiac event (or demand ischemia)
   # Pancreatitis/Cholangitis: Pt noted to have cholangitis and
   pancreatitis on ERCP examination, two stones were extracted from the
   ampulla and common hepatic duct, a sphincterotomy was performed [**12-19**].
   Now with bowel obstruction [**12-21**] pancreatic head: Not a surgical
   candidate at this time.
   - Follow-up final CT read
   - F/U surgery recs
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Persistent renal failure on HD (got this am) [**12-21**] to ATN,
   now s/p contrast load for CT.
   - CVVHD to start this am
   - F/U renal recs
   #Leukocytosis: Initially thought due to c. diff colitis, and although
   c. diff negative, had started resolving with PO vanc.  Now rising again
   in setting of aspiration and hypotension.  6%bands.  Unclear source,
   although PNA or abdominal sources are likely.
   - Pan culture
   - ID following
   - Abx as above
   #Coagulopathy: Likely consistent with early DIC
   - F/U DIC labs q12 hours
   # ?Pulmonary embolism:  Unclear if patient actually has PE
 unable to
   get CTA at this time due to lack of PIV access.
   - Hold heparin in the interim given possibility of needing surgery and
   concerns for hemorrhagic conversion of pancreatitis.
   All other systems as per resident note.

   HPI:
   This is an 89 year old male with a history of dementia, hypertension,
   ESRD on hemodialysis and recent admission for fevers and failure to
   thrive who presents from dialysis with a syncopal episode.  Per notes
   he received 2.5 hours of his dialysis session but during the last 15
   minutes he was noted to slump in his chair and to lose consciousness
   for 2-3 minutes.  There was no overt seizure activity noted.  No tongue
   biting or loss of bowel or bladder function.   No head trauma.  Per EMS
   on arrival he was arrousable but not at his baseline.  He was
   immediately transferred to [**Hospital1 5**].  As per recent discharge summary his
   baseline is ""confused"" and has been deteriorating rapidly over the past
   several months with episodes of delerium and generalized failure to
   thrive.
   In the ED, initial vs were: T: 98.3 P: 90 BP: 150/62 R: 14 O2 sat 95%
   on NRB, FS 98. He had a CXR which was unchanged from prior films.  EKG
   showed normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, normal intervals, no
   acute ST segment changes, no change from prior dated [**2190-10-3**].  He had a
   head CT which shows a large new left sided fluid collection with mass
   effect.  Exam in the emergency room was notable for inability to follow
   commands and withdrawal to painful stimuli.  He was seen by
   neurosurgery who felt that he would be a candidate for [**Month/Day/Year 9860**] hole
   placement if this were within the patient's goals of care.  He is
   admitted to the MICU for further management.
   On the floor he is unable to respond to questions.  He screams out with
   painful stimuli to extremities.  He is able to follow commands to smile
   and close his eyes tightly.  Otherwise further history is unable to be
   obtained.

   Assessment and Plan: This is an 89 year old male with a history of
   dementia, hypertension, ESRD on hemodialysis and recent admission for
   fevers and failure to thrive who presents from dialysis with a syncopal
   episode found to have a new left sided fluid collection on head CT.
   Syncope:  Unclear etiology.  No evidence of cardiac ischemia.  Last
   echocardiogram in [**2187**] showed trivial MR although now exam is notable
   for very harsh HSM at apex.  [**Month (only) 8**] have had a small component of
   orthostasis, dehydration given that this event occurred during
   dialysis.  On exam he is cachectic and unable to respond to questions.
   No clear seizure activity although this cannot be excluded.  After the
   event the patient was noted to be more confused than his baseline
   although his mental status has been fluctuating over the past few
   months with worsening decline.
   - seen by neurosurgery in the emergency room, plan to offer family
   evacuation of fluid collection tomorrow with [**Month (only) 9860**] hole
   - will confirm baseline mental status with family tonight as well as
   goals of care
   - monitor electrolytes
   - consider echocardiogram on Monday given worsening murmur on exam
   - consider EEG
   Left sided intracranial fluid collection:  Unclear if this relates to
   this presentation.  Per report he has had a significant decline over
   the past few months and this may be related to a more subacute
   decline.  Per wife overnight, she would likely not want to pursue
   neurosurgical intervention.
   - appreciate neurosurgical recommendations
   - will consider [**Month (only) 9860**] hold placement in AM
   - NPO after midnight
   - will hold SC heparin in preparation for neurosurgery
   - anesthesia evaluation

   HPI:
   84 yo female with early dementia, HTN, CAD, GERD, PUD and depression
   presents to the ED today after a syncopal episode found to have several
   large melanotic stools. The pt reports she has noted some increase in
   her usual GERD sxs over the last few days, as well as some new, diffuse
   abd pain. The abd pain is described as [**5-15**], ""achy"" and ""annoying"" in
   nature, but non-radiating. Earlier today the pt noted that both sxs
   were even worse than they had been. She was at her [**Hospital3 **] -
   having just moved from a NH earlier in the day - and was seated in a
   chair when she noted the sudden onset of lightheadness and felt like
   she was going to faint. The onset of sxs was not associated with any
   change in her activity (i.e., standing or stress); the pt does not
   thing she lost consciousness and denies any resultant trauma. She
   denies any associated CP, palpitations, SOB. The pt was taken to the ED
   for evaluation where she was noted to have a large melanotic stool; she
   reports she had never had anything similar in the past. The pt was
   treated with a PPI and hydralazine for an SBP in the 240s, and planned
   for admission to the floor, however she subsequently had two additional
   large bowel movements and thus is admitted to the MICU for closer
   monitoring.
   .
   On ROS, the pt denies the sxs described above. Additional she has noted
   no fevers, change in vision or weight. She did not some chills earlier
   in the day today. No trouble swallowing. No diaphoresis or exertional
   dyspnea. No nausea or vomiting. No urinary sxs including frequency,
   urgency or dysuria.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo female presents with syncopal episode and multiple melanotic
   stools.
   .
   #Syncope: Multiple possible etiologies including vasovagal, arrythmia,
   or hypoglycemia, although history is not particularly suggestive for
   any of these. Suspect that if pt has had some ongoing GI bleeding,
   particularly in the setting of abd pain, this could have resulted in
   transient hypotension.
   -monitor on tele
   -aggressive managment of possible GI bleeding as below
   -monitor for evidence of recurrence
   -consider echo before discharge
   .
   #Melanotic stools: Concering for GI bleeding, potentially from upper
   source given pt's prior h/o PUD.
   -[**Hospital1 7**] IV PPI
   -two large bore IVs
   -q6 hr HCTs
   -hold home ASA, atenolol
   -transfuse for HCT <30
   -EGD with GI in AM
   .
   #Abd pain: Ddx includes pain from GIB, bowel ischemia or coronary
   ischemia.
   -ROMI
   -consider CTA abd if clinically worsening but will defer for now given
   renal failure
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Likely stress demargination but bowel ischemia also a
   consideration. No other clear source and thus far afebile.
   -monitor for now, plan as above
   .
   #RF: Pt's Cr is above level in [**2184**] but unclear how far off she is from
   recent baseline. Has received 1L fluid in ED; continue gentle
   hydreation PRN and trend.
   .
   #CAD: Holding ASA and BB in setting of probable acute bleed. Plan to
   re-add as soon as possible. Continue Zetia.
   .
   #HTN: Holding home atenolol. Will monitor for now and treat as needed.
   .
   #Depression/psych: Continue home meds.
   .
   #Hypothyroid: Continue home levothyroxine.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 year old male with h/o HIV, off HAART X3 months (last CD4 200s),
   admitted [**11-4**] with severe HAs X 5 days, found to have cryptococcal
   mennigitis, getting daily LPs for elevated ICP until [**11-10**]. Now with
   refractory hypokalemia likely secondary to ambisome.
   .
   # Hypokalemia: Urinary K+ loss secondary to ambisome. After discussion
   with pharmacy, plan to replete w/ continuous IV KCl at a rate of
   10mEq/hr until adequately repleted, then may decrease rate. Also will
   avoid po KCl as this has give him significant nausea/GI upset. Received
   60 mEq in 1L NS over 6 hrs last night with no improvement in K+. This
   was followed by 80 mEq in 1L NS over 6hrs that is currently running.
   - Increase to KCl at 12-15 mEq/hr and recheck q6hrs - next check due at
   9AM
   - replete Mg aggressively, start with 4gm q6hr, reassess
 currently
   normal at 2.3mg/dL. Will recheck at 9AM and redose as needed.
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Cryptococcal Meningitis: Headaches have resolved completely. previous
   elevated opening pressures, now stablized. Last LP showed decreased
   pressure with elevated WBC but no organisms so far on gram stain or
   culture. The CSF crypto titer >1:64 but this is expected as it may
   change in 2 weeks. Patient is clinically asymptomatic with perfect
   clinical picture and no growth on cultures.
   - appreciate ID following patient.
   - plan to repeat LP w/ opening pressure [**11-16**], last dose 10/17
   - cont flucytosine 1500mg PO q6 (day11), ambisone 400mg IV q24h (day
   [**12-15**]).
   - follow LFTs
   - cont toradol 30mg IV q8 ATC and dilaudid 2mg q3IV prn with bowel
   regimen, zofran and ativan q6 ATC and compazine prn
   .
   # HIV, previously on HAART, but off X 3 months [**3-4**] dysphagia/vomiting
   as well as noncompliance per OSH HIV doctor. No h/o AIDS defining
   illnesses until now.
   -VL 100K, CD4 count is 116, which is higher than expected for someone
   with crypo meningitis
   - treating crypto meningitis as above, will need flucon after
   - started bactrim DS qd proph per ID - switched to liquid formulation.
   -will defer to his outpt HIV MDs regarding restarting ART.
   .
   # Hypomagnesemia: Replete as above, Mg sulfate IV 4gm q 4 hrs until
   repleted.
   .
   # Dysphagia X 3 months, intermittent, with liquids and solids/pills a/w
   pain (during episodes only) and vomiting. No odynophagia. s/p EGD and
   barium swallow 1 month ago, unremarkable. Mostly issues with swallowing
   pills.
   - has been tolerating some of oral meds here, main one is flucytosine.
   not tolerating bactrim (too big), ok with liquid formulation
   - hold on GI consult inpatient unless acute issue, he has GI f/u
   .
   # Depression: Continue seroquel 25 mg qhs.
   .
   # Tobacco abuse: Declining nicotine patch
   .
   # FEN/proph: monitor lytes as above, gen diet as tolerated, TEDs/SCDs,
   no need for PPI, bowel regimen, will ask for PICC placement for easier
   access.
   .
   #Dispo/Code: Full code. Note, family not aware of diagnosis of HIV.
   Partner is aware. Likely D/C on Friday after last dose of ambisome.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o M w/alcohol abuse, left AMA from the MICU yesterday and returned
   90 minutes later with symptoms of EtOH withdrawal.
   1. EtOH withdrawal:  Currently hypertensive and tachycardic but these
   parameters are improving with benzos.
   - continue IV valium prn
   - thiamine, folate, MVT
   2. Agitation:  Likely due to EtOH withdrawal.
   - cont his home medications as confirmed by [**Doctor Last Name 5401**] House
   - Psych consult for assessment of competence
   3. ECG changes: Cardiac enzymes negative x2, will complete a rule out.
   Likely demand in setting of tachycardia and hypertension.  Ideally
   would get a stress although unclear if he will cooperate.

   HPI:
   66-year-old lady with history of breast and bladder cancers was
   admitted for elective EPS with ablation for SVT.  She first noted
   palpitations approximately 16 years ago in the setting of high
   emotional distress when her son was killed while in the service.
   Since then, she has had palpitations in the setting of
   chemotherapy, and over the past years has had no more than [**3-2**]
   episodes per year. However, on the day of her most recent
   cystoscopy on [**3-5**] at [**Hospital1 5791**], she
   experienced a tachycardia, which was terminated after she
   received intravenous Lopressor. The same tachycardia occurred on
   [**3-9**] for which she presented to [**Hospital6 3851**]
   Emergency Room, where the tachycardia was terminated with
   intravenous adenosine. The tracings of the tachycardia were reviewed by
   her Electrophysiologist, Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 5758**], and thought be a narrow
   complex tachycardia at 150 beats/minute with an RP interval of 100-120
   msec. However, immediately post adenosine, there was evidence of sinus
   rhythm with a fully pre-excited QRS complex consistent with a
   left lateral bypass tract. Since the Emergency Room visit, she
   has been on low-dose atenolol without further recurrences of the
   arrhythmia. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 9963**] recommended EPS with ablation and the
   patient was admitted today for the procedure.
   .
   During the procedure she developed hypotension to SBP of 77 mm HG.
   This responded to IVF and dopamine infusion to SBP of 130s.  Patient
   was mentating appropriately.  Focal views of TTE showed
   noncircumferential pericardial effusion with mild RA collapse without
   RV collapse.  Her heparin was reversed with protamine.  PA
   catheterization showed preserved CO, no equalization of filling
   pressures, and preserved Y descent on RA tracing.  This suggested
   nonhemodynamically significant effusion.  Patient was admitted to CCU
   with PA catheter for close hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   On arrival patient complained of stable pleuritic chest pain which she
   had since the cath lab.  She denied any shortness of breath.  No other
   complaints.
   .
   REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denies fever, chills, headaches, blurred
   vision, constipation, nausea, vomitting, shortness of breath, PND,
   orhtopnea, lower extremity edema.  No history of pulmonary embolus,
   DVT, stroke, melena, BRBPR, blood in urine.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 y/o lady with h/o SVT now with pericardial effusion s/p attempted
   ablation.
   .
   # Pericardial Effusion/PUMP:  Complicated SVT ablation procedure with ?
   perofration.  TTE focused view with 1.4 cm anterior effusion.  s/p RHC
   and swan ganz in place.  Heparin reversed in cath lab with protamine.
   ? difficulty crossing LV concernig for AS.
   - if RA pressure increase (currently 20) or BP drops will need emergent
   pericardiocentesis
   - repeat TTE in AM
   - post cath check
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Currently in sinus rhthm.  Her SVT with evidence of left
   lateral bypass tract and pre-excitation.  Incomplete ablation procedure
   as above.
   - monitor on tele
   - will need full dose ASA on discharge given extensive scarring during
   the procedure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  No known CAD.  Her current chest pain is most likely due
   to hemopericardium.
   - holding ASA for now as above.
   .
   # Extensive groin manipulation:  During the procedures today.
   - monitor for any evidence of RP bleed, low thresh-hold to scan
   .
   #  H/o breast CA and papillary bladder CA:
   - need out patient follow up.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for now; could advance diet to cardiac heart healthy diet in
   AM if she is hemodynamically stable; replete lytes prn
