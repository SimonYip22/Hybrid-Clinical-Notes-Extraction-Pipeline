# NLP Unstructured Clinical Notes Extractor

***Hybrid Natural Language Processing Architecture Using ClinicalBERT Classifier & Rule-Based Entity Extraction for Clinical Data Formatting***

---

## Executive Summary

**Tech stack:** ***Python, PyTorch, pandas, NumPy***

A dual-architecture natural language processing pipeline using a transformer-based (ClinicalBERT) classifier and rule-based entity extraction to process unstructured ICU data and produce formatted clinical text.

This project focuses on classical clinical NLP pipeline design rather than ontology mapping or production deployment.
